# Alation

Alation package provides integration with the [Alation](https://www.alation.com/) data catalog platform. It allows opening tables and running existing queries in Datagrok, which then can be analyzed and manipulated with Datagrok's powerful toolset.

_Note that to open a table or run a query you need to provide access credentials._
