1. Open linked datasets
2. Click the canonical_smiles column's header.
3. Go to the Context Pane and check all info panels (tabs).
Note: for testing panel Chemistry -> Rendering use chembl_scaffolds.cvs dataset from Chem package files. Choose 'Scaffold' as a Scaffold column and check 'Highlight scaffold'. Molecules in "Smiles" column should be aligned by scaffold and scaffold should be highlighted 

***

1. Open linked datasets (need to check smiles, molV2000, molV3000, smarts formats)
2. Make sure that structures of molecules are rendered.
3. Click a cell with a structure.
4. Check that all necessary panels are displayed on the **Context Panel.**
5. Expand each tab on the **Context Panel**.
6. Make sure the content for each info panel is displayed correctly.
