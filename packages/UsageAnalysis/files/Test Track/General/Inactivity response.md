### Platform Behavior After 20 Minutes of Inactivity
Verify that the platform functions correctly after a period of 20 minutes of inactivity.

1. Open platform. (User is logged in). Begin a timer to track 20 minutes of inactivity on the platform.
2. Do not interact. Leave the platform idle without any user interaction for the duration of the 20-minute timer.
3. Post-onactivity interaction. After 20 minutes, interact with the platform by performing the following actions:
  * Navigate to any section (e.g., Dashboards, Databases, or Plugins). Review console outputs for errors that might have occurred during the period of inactivity or during the first interaction afterward.
  * Open a data file or project.
  * Run a query and a script.
4. Observe if the platform is responsive. Verify that there are no unexpected delays or errors. 
5. Expected result:
* The platform remains stable and responsive after 20 minutes of inactivity.
* No errors or unexpected behavior should occur when resuming interaction with the platform.
* Console outputs should not show any errors related to the inactivity period.
