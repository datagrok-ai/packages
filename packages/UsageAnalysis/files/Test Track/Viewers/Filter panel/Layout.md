1. Open the filter panel, clone view layout (Top Menu > View > Layout > Clone view).
2. Set any filter on any view, it should apply filter to both views.
3. Save the layout (on Toolbox: Layout > Save).
4. Add some more filtering.
5. Apply the previously saved layout.

Expected: both layout and filtering of the dataframe should be applied to the dataset from layout
