  Only declarative equations description is required.
  # Essence
  Simulation of controlled fab-arm exchange kinetic mechanism is performed here.
  # Performance
  1000 times faster than the previous version.
  # Complexity
  Each time you press "RUN", a system of 13 non-linear ordinary differential equations is solved.`;
