# Bioreactors

Bioreactors is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platform. Mechanism of Controlled Fab-Arm Exchange is simulated (see paper Dennis R. Goulet et. al. ["Kinetic mechanism of controlled Fab-arm exchange for the formation of bispecific immunoglobulin G1 antibodies"](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra117.000303)).
