# ChaRPy changelog

## 1.0.4 (WIP)

Initial release of ChaRPy

*Dependency: datagarok-api >= 1.0.0*

### Features

Package provides two commands for Datagrok viewers, "To Python script" and "To R script", which translate a selected viewer
to Python or R code, respectively, along with executing this code for displaying the resulting plot. The two commands
are available via a hamburger menu (a top-left button in a viewer's header), and supported for most of the viewers in
Datagrok.
