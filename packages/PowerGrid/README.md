# PowerGrid

PowerGrid contains popular spreadsheet extensions, such as [sparklines](#sparklines) and support for [images](#images).

## Sparklines

Sparklines are very small charts, typically without axes or coordinates. The main goal of a sparkline is to provide a
graphical representation of data row that to get an impression of the object as a whole, and to 
instantly compare objects with each other. To form a representation, any quantitative features of objects can
be used, which are displayed as the position or size of a graphical element. Datagrok has a few ready-to-use sparkline
chart types: `sparklines`, `bar chart`, `pie chart` and `radar chart`. 

To add a sparkline column, open `Add | Summary Columns | ...` from the grid's popup menu.

To customize a sparkline column, click on its header and expand the `Renderer` pane in the property panel.

## Images

Datagrok supports two types of images in cells: embedded and linked.

### Embedded images

To programmatically add an image column to the dataframe, use the following
code:  ```dataFrame.columns.addNewBytes('my image')```.

To add an image, double-click on the cell and choose the file. Supported extensions are `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.jpeg`.

### Linked images

Datagrok automatically detects and visualizes images saved as URLs (those starting with "http://"
or "https://", and ending with one of the supported image extensions). In case the image did not
get automatically detected, click on the column, press `F2` to open the column properties, and set
the following:
* `quality` to `ImageUrl`
* `cell.renderer` to `ImageUrl`.

The images might not occur instantaneously. If this happens, clone the layout (Layout | Clone).
We are working to get that fixed.
