# Example 1: export of C-functions

Files lib1.c & lib2.c contain exported functions, which are annotated in a proper way.

In the file module.json, an appropriate settings of the export script are given.

The file package.js contains results automatically generated by the script export.py, 
as well as manually added functions for testing.
