I never knew it was the medication until I went back to see my allergist a year after starting the drug. I quit it immediately and saw relief from the craving to eat. A doctor told me later that the thing that makes the allergy pill effective also STIMULATES THE APPETITE. I said I would not take that one. He said, Actually, they ALL work like that. I'm wondering if the mother of the toddler who became cranky on the medication wasn't expressing that craving, since he probably wasn't able to say it.

Too much lithium lead to unwanted effects: nausea, severe case diarrhea at times with less than 1 min. to park it on a commode! My hands/fingers had slight twitch off & on. No dizziness, seizures,or slurred speech.  Maybe increase in urine relayed to fluid intakes. I found 1200 mg/day was too scary for me!  

I was ""Stuck"" in the middle of the roller coaster ride, half way up-half way down. No super highs at the top, & no bottom gut wrenching lows.

NO FEELINGS, NO ENGAGEMENTS JUST A ZOMBIE IN LIFE!

After 7 yrs on Lithium ('79-'86) I got off!

I rode the roller coaster called LIFE! UPS, DOWNS, & all the good & bad in between for over 20 years.

I WOULD NOT EXCHANGE ONE MINUTE OF IT.  LIFE'S TOO SHORT, DON'T LIVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S EXPECTATIONS.

With Lithium, a ""tad"" too much in your system and you're getting manic, ""tad"" too low suicide creeps back.  Problem: Doctors Rx @ 300,600,900,1200mg's. but your body may only need 725 mg.

CLOSER blood lithium monitoring should be like it is for diabetics. 
 

WEB MD: TALK to your Dr. IMMEDIATELY! if these.... effects occur they MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

I'm back on 1200mg Lithium, Aug. '07. Diarrhia was killing me 3-4x/day for 2 wks in Nov. 07.  Old Dr. cut me to 900 mg and it went away.  New dr. put me back to 1200mg & guess what!?  So last week my new Dr. changed my Rx to DIVALPROEX 500mg 2x/day.  

I'm scared as hell! Divalproex causes: 1st symptom  is ""diarrhia"" as too much Lithium!  The sweet spot Divalproex ""has rarely caused serious (sometimes fatal)liver problems"".  A disabled vet, in need of his disability pay must take the new medicine. If I am around in 5-6 mo. I will repost! Live Long!

There is only a small difference between the correct amount of lithium and too much lithium. Therefore, it is important that your doctor monitor you closely during treatment. Keep all medical and laboratory appointments while you are taking lithium."
