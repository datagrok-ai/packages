# Timelines

Timelines view allows to visualize events flow in time. X axis is time axis reflecting study days. On Y axis there are subjects.
Events are shown either as a point(in case event lased for one day) or as a line (for cases events were prolonged in time)

Adverse events, investigational drug exposure and concomitant medication domains are available for analysis(in case SDTM data contains corresponding tables). Filters can also be applied for each domain.

By zooming in and out you can drill down to particular patient and event or otherwise see the picture of events in general.

Information about particular event is available in tooltip on mouse hover or in a context panel by clicking on event. In case event is an AE you can go to Adverse event browser by clicking on AE name.

Several domains can be shown simultaneously on the graph. For instance, the following screenshot shows severe general and cardiac disorders VS aspirin intake.
