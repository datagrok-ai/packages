# Correlations

Correlation matrix shows relations between biomarkers/vital signs values for all subjects at the selected visit.

On diagonal you can see histograms showing biomarker distribution. Cells at the intersection of certain biomarkers contain correlation coefficient for that pair of biomarkers. By hovering mouse over correlation coefficient you will see scatter plot with corresponding biomarkers values in a tooltip.

By default correlation matrix is created for first 20 biomarkers at the earliest study visit. Visit as well as biomarkers can be further changed via dropdown list and settings button above the boxplots.
