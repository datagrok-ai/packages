# Distributions

The view shows distribution for selected biomarker/vital signs values for all subjects at selected visit splitted by selected parameter. It is useful to evaluate median, upper and lower quartiles and outliers. And since distributions in each boxplot can be grouped by certain parameter it is also possible to evaluate difference in biomarker/vital signs values distribution between different groups.

By default 4 biomarkers with min p-value at the earliest study visit splitted by treatment arm are shown. Baseline visit, split parameter as well as biomarkers can be further changed via dropdown lists and settings button above the boxplots.
