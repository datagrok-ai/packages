# Time profile

This view contains line chart which allows to evaluate laboratory/vital signs dynamics in time. X axis is time axis showing days of study. Y axis is biomarker level scale.

There are 2 types of chart representation:

- Non-normalized biomarkers results
- Relative changes from baseline

Domain, type of graph, value and visits thresholds can be selected in the ribbon panel above chart. Line chart is splitted by treatment arm by default. But parameter to split by can be also changed.

Each value on the graph is represented as distribution. By default points represent median, whiskers represent upper and lower quartiles. Type of distribution can also be changed in context panel.
