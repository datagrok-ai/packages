<Card meta={meta}>

I was six years old when I wrote my first program in Basic, and since then, I have been captivated by computers and all things digital. At 15, I took on a programming side job and was struck by how much I enjoyed it. Now, I work at Datagrok, where I am responsible for the overall platform architecture and development of the backend features, making the experience for applied developers and data scientists smoother and more productive.

My personal motto is to simplify people's lives and leave everything better than I found it. I am driven by making processes faster and more efficient. During my time at commercial banks, I created tools that transformed hours-long processes into seconds. I also find great satisfaction in tackling real-world problems, and I am proud of my contribution to a team researching autism spectrum disorder where I helped develop a data processing pipeline. Incidentally, this project is how I met Andrew Skalkin, the founder of Datagrok.

For me, working at Datagrok requires a deep love for computer science and a comprehensive understanding of how computers work. It also requires a desire to make the world a better and more understandable place.

In my free time, I enjoy building electronic devices, composing music, and playing the electric guitar. Fun fact: my passion for electronic devices led me to earn a Master's degree in Radio-electronics Engineering.
