<Card meta={meta}>

I'm Andrew Skalkin, founder and CEO of Datagrok, Inc. I'm a computer scientist and entrepreneur who's passionate about making data accessible and actionable for everyone.

Before starting Datagrok in 2019, I spent 17 years at Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson, where I held various positions in R&D IT, including software engineer, architect, scientist, and manager. I gained extensive experience in multiple domains such as cheminformatics, health informatics, LIMS, bioinformatics, biomarker research, drug development and manufacturing, statistical process control, biosensor data integration, and clinical data analysis. 

I'm proud of my work at Janssen, where I designed and built innovative solutions that are still used by thousands of scientists today. One of my most notable projects was ABCD, an integrated drug discovery informatics platform, and another was JAKE, the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine, a biosensor-driven platform for enabling clinical trials for autism spectrum disorder.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. When I'm not running Datagrok, I enjoy reading, hiking, and playing tennis.
