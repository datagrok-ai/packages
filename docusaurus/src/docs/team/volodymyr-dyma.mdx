<Card meta={meta}>

Growing up, I was into video games and dreamt of creating games that others would enjoy playing. However, as I pursued a degree in computer science, I stumbled upon the fascinating field of data science and its potential to advance biology and medicine research. This sparked my interest, and I now work as part of Datagrok's bioinformatics team, where I have contributed to the development of a comprehensive peptide analysis tool. The project started soon after I joined Datagrok, and it has grown into something thousands of scientists can use daily. The project's growth has mirrored my own personal growth, and it's exciting to see the package improve with every commit!

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing video games, dancing, spending time with my cat, and talking with friends.

Working with passionate and enthusiastic people is important to me. I value a desire to learn and grow in my colleagues.
