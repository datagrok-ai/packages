<Card meta={meta}>

My name is Olena, I graduated with a degree in Biotechnology, but my career has taken me in many directions. Starting as a sales manager and then working as a marketer, I was well prepared when I decided to pursue a career as a recruiter. My first recruitment experience was at a start-up, but the company was unfortunately forced to close due to the war.

When I discovered Datagrok, I was thrilled to learn that the company's work was related to science and aligned with my academic background. From the moment I met the team, I felt a strong connection and was impressed by their dedication.

Working at Datagrok is a truly unique experience. You are surrounded by smart, knowledgeable individuals who inspire and encourage you to keep learning and growing. The company values creativity and encourages employees to think outside the box, making it a great environment for professional development.
