<Card meta={meta}>

As someone with a background in Applied Linguistics, one of my first assignments at the company was to develop an NLP plugin for the platform. By now, Iâ€™ve made significant contributions in various areas, including visualization packages, developer tools, documentation, educational resources, and the core development of the platform.

In my free time, I enjoy ice skating, kayaking, and reading, but I have a diverse range of interests and enjoy trying new activities.

When it comes to a future colleague, I value resilience, a professional demeanor, and a willingness to embrace new ideas.
