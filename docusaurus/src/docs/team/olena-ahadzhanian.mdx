<Card meta={meta}>

I have a rich academic background, having earned a Master's in Applied Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Technical Sciences. I spent over a decade as an Assistant Professor in the Cyber Security and Software Department at Odessa National Polytechnic University, where I authored over 50 scientific papers in three languages, reviewed and edited multiple scientific articles, and presented at conferences.

My journey at Datagrok started as a technical writer, but I soon discovered my interest in the technical aspects of our solutions. I now work on the Quality Assurance team, making sure our products are bug-free, user-friendly, and intuitive.   

Working at Datagrok requires a combination of creativity, attention to detail, and open-mindedness. I'm happy I can transalte these skills into something tangible, like the stability of our platform or enhanced user experience of our products.
