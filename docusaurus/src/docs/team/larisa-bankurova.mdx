<Card meta={meta}>

As the CFO/COO of Datagrok, my focus is on guiding the company's financial strategy and  making sure operations run smoothly through a cohesive approach to finance and ops.  

I've been in the tech industry for over a decade, working with both private and public tech companies. I've had a mix of hands-on experience and leadership roles, giving me a broad understanding of how data and technology trends can be applied to optimize financial and operational processes and drive business success.

I began my career at Deloitte, where I developed a strong foundation in public accounting and went on to hold finance roles of increasing responsibility in the industry, including serving as Corporate Controller at EPAM Systems (NYSE: EPAM), where I helped the company during its successful IPO. I then became the VP of Finance at Aricent (acquired by Altran) and later at WorkFusion, growing my expertise in the SaaS domain.

Through these diverse experiences, I have honed my ability to work collaboratively, lead cross-functional teams, and execute complex financial and operational strategies.

When I'm not working, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors through hiking, playing tennis, and indulging in a good book. As a fun fact, I embarked on a three-month-long road trip in 2016 and had the opportunity to visit almost every state in the continental US. And I also climbed Kilimanjaro!
