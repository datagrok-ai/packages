<Card meta={meta}>

I was deeply invested in the study of automated control systems at the university and my passion led me to earn a Ph.D. three years after graduation. After dedicating 15 years to academia, I sought a change and found my calling in the field of DevOps engineering and infrastructure management automation. My interest in computers, networks, and related technologies made this a natural fit for me.

As a junior DevOps engineer at Datagrok, I am loving every moment of my job where I get to bring digital worlds to life or end them by scripting. Off work, I enjoy riding my BMW.

In my short time at Datagrok, I am particularly proud of my work on two projects: an infrastructure monitoring system for a non-cloud platform solution and an AWS CloudFormation template for infrastructure as code for cloud platform solutions. The challenge was to create a configurable monitoring system and effectively tune the alerts system, which I successfully overcame.

To be part of the Datagrok team, one needs an open mind, a desire for continuous learning, and strong interpersonal skills. Teamwork is key and the more challenges, the better.
