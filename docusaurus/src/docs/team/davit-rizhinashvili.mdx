<Card meta={meta}>

I've been a science fan since school. I won three national titles in chemistry and represented Georgia in global events, like the ICHO and Mendeleev Olympiads, bringing home three medals. At university, my focus shifted to biology, coding, and ML, where I co-authored several research papers.

I love working with data, especially bioinformatics. It's even more exciting for me than working in a lab. That's why I've spent time on various pharma projects, where my focus has been on generating, analyzing, and processing biological data. Now, I'm with Datagrok as a Scientific Application Developer. My role? Enhance and grow the scientific tools for our platform. Tech's awesome - I get to innovate, yet balance my work with fun times with friends and sports.

Thinking about joining us at Datagrok? Get ready to learn and take some risks. You've got to be excited about making something new and uniqueâ€”not just sticking to the playbook. Communication is important, too. Our team's really supportive, and it's great if you can do the same for others.
