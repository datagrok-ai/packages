<Card meta={meta}>

I have a background in theoretical physics, holding a Master's and PhD degree in the field. My area of expertise was general relativity and its modifications inspired by cosmology and particle physics. After 8 years in academia, I joined the Datagrok team. My interests span mathematics and modern data analysis methods applied to natural sciences, which is why I find working at Datagrok an incredible experience. I get to work with state-of-the-art technology in bioinformatics and cheminformatics, tackle complex problems, and continuously develop professionally.

The open-minded and constructive atmosphere of the company deserves a special mention, as I learn a lot from my colleagues and am happy to share my knowledge with them when it is helpful. It is all about staying focused and getting things done effectively.
