<Card meta={meta}>

My Dad is a software engineer, and my mom is a quality assurance engineer, so I suppose I was destined to become part of the IT world. When I was little, I thought that Information Technology was like magic. How can green letters on the black screen, like in The Matrix, connect people worldwide? Isn’t it fascinating? Now I think of myself as a magician.

After school, I used a gap year to understand what I wanted to do in this world. I was bored, so I asked my father if he had any challenging tasks for me to practice. That’s how my path began, without university or any other required education. It turned out that being a DevOps engineer is like solving puzzles and investigating mysterious cases, just like in computer games which I always liked.

My work started with hands-on tasks, and I used every year on my path to burnish my skills.

Datagrok was the first company that allowed me to build the whole infrastructure from scratch. It is the greatest challenge I have faced, and we are going to infinity and beyond. I cannot wait to see our serverless computational service for clients. At Datagrok, I also lead DevOps and QA teams.

Working in Datagrok can be demanding. It allows you to bring your expertise to an entirely new level. The person needs to be passionate and responsible about work.
