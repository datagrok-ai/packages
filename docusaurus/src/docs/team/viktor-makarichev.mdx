<Card meta={meta}>

With a background in Physics and Mathematics, I specialize in creating image processing technologies drawing on my Ph.D. research. My work has resulted in 27 scientific papers, 10 patented software programs, and various scientific accolades.

At Datagrok, I design high-performance data analysis functions and solutions for complex processes. I thrive on using low-level algorithms to build fast-working tools and the challenge of seamlessly integrating technologies for the best outcomes.

Working at Datagrok is a unique experience, as the team is driven by their own vision, leading to innovative and highly effective solutions to intricate problems. It requires a flexible mindset and the ability to think outside the box.

In my free time, I enjoy playing lego with my son and preparing for mountain adventures.
