<Card meta={meta}>

I earned a degree in industrial electronics and computer science at the institute, which gave me a comprehensive understanding of how digital devices operate at a physical level. After graduation, I worked as a software developer in the industry for several years before encountering a biologist who piqued my interest in image analysis of gel electrophoresis of nucleic acid fragments. This sparked a desire to study biology, and I eventually earned my PhD in Genetics and Mathematical Biology, focusing on methods for unbiased screening of DNA methylation. My thesis, I presented a solution for downsampling target genome loci via PCR primer extension, which was based on the known human genome sequence.

My most thrilling project was developing a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing method to identify markers of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and analyzing the resulting data. Currently, I am part of the Datagrokâ€™s bioinformatics team, where we create comprehensive tools for visualizing and analyzing macromolecule sequences and related biological and chemical observations.
