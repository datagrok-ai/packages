<Card meta={meta}>

With an MSc in Biotechnology and Chemical Technology and interdisciplinary expertise in computing, mathematical modeling, and mathematical biology, I am now pursuing a Ph.D. in Mathematical Biology and Bioinformatics, specializing in drug design. My thesis work involves creating novel classification machine learning techniques for virtual screening.

Prior to joining Datagrok, I collaborated with industry, research institutes, and academic institutions on various mathematical biology initiatives to advance drug design, including developing new mathematical methods and structure descriptions for small molecules for virtual screening and analyzing chemical datasets. One of my most exciting projects was creating a machine learning approach for classifying compounds based on biological activity.

At Datagrok, I lead the development of tailored applications for early research and discovery in biopharmaceuticals. I am responsible for biological data mining and visualization, designing mathematical algorithms, performing high-performance scientific computing, and simulating biological systems.

I am eager to work with anyone motivated by the opportunity to work on drug discovery projects that merge science, technology, and computational methods.

In my leisure time, I am an avid mountaineer.
