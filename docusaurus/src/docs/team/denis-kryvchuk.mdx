<Card meta={meta}>

I have a strong background in computer science and have also studied natural sciences such as astronomy, chemistry, and physics. However, I eventually decided to focus my career on programming. Currently, I work on the Datagrokâ€™ Platform Core team, where my role is to support data visualizations and maintain the overall platform structure.

What I am most proud of in my work at Datagrok is the implementation of new features and support for our data visualization tools. These tools greatly benefit scientists and it is fulfilling to see satisfied clients.

In my free time, I often spend time with friends or continue my studies.

For anyone looking to join our team, the qualities I value most are passion, a strong desire to learn, and a positive attitude.
