<Card meta={meta}>

I have a Bachelor's degree in Finance from Kyiv National Economic University, where I developed a strong foundation in financial analysis, management, and planning. Furthermore, I have accumulated ten years of professional experience in various financial roles and industries, including audit, transportation, and IT sectors. These diverse experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of financial principles and best practices.

My primary objective is to ensure the financial health and stability of our organization. I am dedicated to improving our financial performance and optimizing resource allocation, with the ultimate goal of maximizing efficiency and success.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I have a passion for biking, yogging, and traveling. Engaging in these activities allows me to unwind, gain fresh perspectives, and nurture my creativity.
