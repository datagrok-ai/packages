<Card meta={meta}>

As a student of Computational Linguistics, I stumbled upon Data Science during my third year at a Linguistics University. The field of Data Science in the IT world has captivated me ever since. I even created a mini-course on NLP basics, which has been taught at the university for a number of years. My interest in Life Sciences later led me to enroll in the Biology faculty, where I began using Data Science to address biomedical issues. 

Currently, I work as a technical writer at Datagrok, exploring the connection between Data Science and Life Sciences. To succeed here, I think one needs to possess the ability to think outside the box, be highly adaptable, and have a genuine love for science. These three traits are essential in overcoming any challenges that come up along the way.

In my free time, I enjoy composing, arranging, and improvising music, writing and narrating stories, working on personal projects, and going on camping trips on foot or by bicycle. I have also completed several smaller personal projects aimed at automating my life.
