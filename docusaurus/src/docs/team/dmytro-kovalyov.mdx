<Card meta={meta}>

I pursued computer science in both college and university, driven by my passion for coding that began in high school. I'm grateful for my decision to pursue this field as it brings me joy and fulfillment even today.

At Datagrok, Iâ€™m part of the Platform Core team. One of the projects I enjoyed was working on the platform viewers and consolidating them into a single package. The process was challenging as it involved code analysis, rewriting in TypeScript, and refactoring, but now we have a unified charts package and I'm proud of my accomplishment.

In my free time, I like staying active, watching various sports, especially football, and engaging in physical activities like training and walking.

Datagrok presents a unique and thrilling project with its range of challenges and opportunities. Working here requires a flexible and adaptable mindset, as you're constantly presented with different problems that test and improve your skills as a developer.
