        <h3>Built from first principles</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike many platforms that grew through patchwork and acquisitions, Datagrok wasn't put together — it was architected. We started with a clean slate and a clear goal: to build a browser-native, modular platform for immersive data exploration. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The platform's core is a high-performance engine that runs entirely in memory. It powers real-time analytics at scale, handling millions of data points right in the browser.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           To make it intuitive and flexible, our solution was: <em>everything is a function</em>. From databases to molecules to metadata — everything is connected, composable, and instantly accessible. Script in the languages you already use; extend with a full-code using JavaScript API; and integrate with the rest of your tools through REST. 
        </p>

        <p>
           Datagrok gives you the speed, power, and flexibility.

    <h3>Perfected for life sciences</h3>

    <p>
      Life science data tells a complex story with layers of meaning.
      That spreadsheet on your screen may actually be a molecular library or sequences with subtle mutations.
      Context is everything — and we understand that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you are filtering compounds with a sketcher or analyzing binding motifs, Datagrok truly <em>groks</em> what you're working with. It adapts automatically, bringing forward the right tools and enriching your analysis with insights.  
    </p>

    <p>
      And as your science evolves, so does Datagrok. Add new data types, tools, or apps — all on the same powerful foundation, without starting over.

        <h3>Amplifies everything around it</h3>
        <p>
          As scientists, we know drug efficacy depends on both compound and target. As developers, we understand that real value comes from how tools work together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take a sketcher. In Datagrok, you can switch between multiple sketchers with a click — all support various notations, identifiers, and even common names like "aspirin." But each one also goes further: it's a filter, a structure search, and a model input — supporting SAR exploration, database search, compound triage, and analog design.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          In Datagrok, components and tools don't just coexist; they communicate, enhance one another, and unlock workflows that weren't previously possible.
