            Everything starts with data. But discovery — real, repeatable discovery — demands more.
            You need to <em>see</em> patterns, <em>understand</em> context, <em>learn</em> from signals, and <em>build on</em> shared insight.
            
            That's what Datagrok was built for.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Datagrok, data is more than strings or integers — it's molecules, plates, and biomarkers.
            Alive. Interactive. Contextual.
            
            Design, model, test, and analyze — all in one environment, built for the way science actually happens. 
            
            This platform doesn't ask your science to bend — it adapts to it. And then, it amplifies it.
            
            As it should be.

        <p>
          Most platforms evolve reactively — shaped by narrow use cases, legacy constraints, and fragmented decisions.
          
          Datagrok is different. It wasn't assembled — it was meticulously architected from first principles, guided by our mission:

          Help scientists not just work with data — but understand it. And make breakthroughs.

          At the core is a high-performance, in-memory data engine — built for interactive exploration on millions of data points, in the browser.
          Visualizations are GPU-accelerated, context-aware, and deeply integrated with the engine.
          
          A cross-language compute engine scales well and runs seamlessly across systems, whether local or remote.

          Everything is a function — queries, predictive models, scripts.
          Functions are first-class entities — parameterized, annotated, scriptable, searchable, and reusable across tools and workflows.          

          The platform itself is modular by design.
          You can add new functionality, build domain-specific tools, integrate with your stack — without breaking what's already working.
          
          Datagrok is built to scale with your science — and evolve alongside it.

        <p>
          Life sciences data tells complex stories — stories generic tools can't uncover.
          Stories that demands not just the processing power, but also context.         
        </p>
        <p>
          In Datagrok, data has semantics: molecules, sequences, curves.
          Not just values — meaning.
          
          Functions build on these types, unlocking infinite possibilities. 
          Sketchers filter your dataset by substructure.
          Toxicity models surface predictions — in info panes, tooltips, or as calculated columns.
          Scatterplots reveal activity cliffs, not just correlations. Spreadsheets transform into DMTA dashboards.
          
          Every function understands your data, so the entire interface adapts — surfacing the right tools, at the right moment. 
                    
          And it scales. SAR exploration happens at the speed of thought.
          UMAP on 100,000 molecules runs in seconds. Plugins seamlessly extend the platform with new data types, models, and domain-specific workflows.      
                                                         
        </p>
        <p>
          Built on this powerful foundation, Datagrok doesn't just handle life science data — it helps you <em>grok</em> it.

        <p>
          In science, breakthroughs rarely happen in isolation.
          The same is true for software — real power comes from synergy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Datagrok doesn't just assemble tools — it orchestrates them.
          Each component connects, informs, and enhances the other.
          
          Sketch a structure - and it filters your dataset, feeds models, builds queries.
          That one action sets off ten other - toxicity alerts, drug likeness scores, and similarity searches.
          
          That's amplification.
        </p>
        <p>
          This principle runs throughout the platform.
          
          Visualizations become scientific tools: scatterplots reveal chemical space, matched molecular pairs, and activity cliffs.
          Data from one domain augments another - peptide sequences display alongside their molecular structures, SAR insights inform hit design downstream.

          It's not just efficiency. It's acceleration — those moments when something clicks, and science moves forward.
