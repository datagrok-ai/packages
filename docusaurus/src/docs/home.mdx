            Everything starts with data. To make discoveries, you need to <em>see</em> its patterns, <em>understand</em> its context, <em>learn</em> from its signals, and <em>build on</em> collective insight.
            That's what Datagrok is built for.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Datagrok, data isn't just rows and columns — it's biomarkers, molecules, and dose-response curves.
            It's interactive, contextual, and ready to drive decisions.
            Design, model, test, and analyze — all in one environment that supports how science actually happens.
            A platform that doesn't bend your science, but shapes around it — amplifying and compounding its impact.
            As it should be.

        <p>
          Most platforms grow reactively — shaped by niche use cases, acquisitions, or architectural constraints.
          Datagrok was meticulously architected from the ground up, guided by our mission:

          to build a browser-native platform that helps scientists understand their data — and act on it.

          At the core is a high-performance, in-memory data engine built for interactive exploration on millions of data points — right in the browser.
          Visualizations are context-aware, GPU-accelerated, modular, and tightly coupled with the engine.
          
          A compute engine manages execution across languages and systems.
          You can run computations in Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, or Octave — locally or remotely.

          Everything is a function — from datasets to molecules to metadata.
          Functions are first-class entities — searchable, parameterized, annotated, and reusable across tools and workflows.          

          Because the platform is modular by design, it adapts naturally.
          You can extend functionality, integrate with your stack, or build new tools — without ever breaking what's already there.
          
          Datagrok is built to scale with your science — and evolve alongside it.

        <p>
          Life science data isn't just rows and columns — it tells complex stories that can't be uncovered by generic tools.
          It requires not only processing power, but also context.         
        </p>
        <p>
          In Datagrok, data has meaning through semantic types — it's not strings, it's molecules and curves.
          
          Functions build on these types, unlocking infinite possibilities. 
          A sketcher filters a dataset by substructure.
          A toxicity model transforms molecules into predictions that appear in tooltips, info panes, or as calculated columns.
          Visualizations become scientific tools: scatterplots show activity cliffs, spreadsheets are DMTA dashboards.
          The entire interface transforms - presenting just the right menus, insights, and tools when you need them. 
                    
          But we take it further - plugins seamlessly add support for new data types, models, and specialized workflows.
          Everything runs at scale — UMAP on 100K sequences completes in seconds, exploration happens at the speed of thought.
                                               
        </p>
        <p>
          Built on a powerful foundation, Datagrok doesn't just handle life science data, it helps you <em>grok</em> it.

        <p>
          In science and technology, the most powerful advances come from synergy. 
          Just as a drug's effectiveness depends on both compound and target, a platform's value comes from how its components interact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Datagrok doesn't just assemble tools — it orchestrates them through a unified architecture where every component connects, informs, and enhances the rest.
          
          A sketcher, for example, isn't just for drawing molecules. It filters datasets, builds queries, and feeds models.
          The structure you sketch becomes the starting point for property predictions, SAR analysis, and synthesis planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          This principle runs throughout the platform. 
           A scatterplot reveals chemical space, activity cliffs, and matched pairs.
           A model becomes part of a decision-making loop.
           Data from one domain augments another — creating insights neither could provide alone.

          The result is more than efficiency. It's those aha moments that move science forward.
