Location: Remote | Start: ASAP

Datagrok is a comprehensive data analytics platform tailored for drug discovery.
It can be used as a self-service tool for exploratory data analytics (think
Excel meets Tableau on steroids). Additionally, there is a rich ecosystem of
apps and plugins.

As a UX/UI designer, you'll create intuitive interfaces that enable diverse user
groups — scientists, business users, and R&D IT — to seamlessly
navigate between broad data exploration, dashboards, and specialized tasks, all
within a unified, cohesive environment.

Make no mistake, this will be hard. The platform must be comprehensive yet not
overwhelming. Different apps should look and feel familiar. Dashboards need to
work well in both creation and consumption modes. New users should feel
comfortable from day one, but not at the expense of power users. 

This role demands exceptional UX skills and a commitment to creating user
experiences that are both powerful and intuitive. You'll face complex problems
that will push your limits. Be ready for a fast-paced, demanding environment
that will keep your hands full.

## Ideally, you

* Have a degree related to life science or have worked in biopharma
* Have designed complex enterprise software while keeping the UX simple and intuitive
* Can code prototypes in JS/TS
* Can create magical experiences for users where everything just feels right

## You will

* Design and improve all user-facing aspects of our platform and apps
* Ensure UI/UX consistency across the entire ecosystem (UI components, apps, etc.)
* Work with scientists directly to translate goals and workflows into requirements and mockups
* Work closely with the engineering team on implementing the designs
* Instill the principles of good UI/UX throughout the company and mentor developers
* Co-create marketing content and product web pages 

## Requirements

* 5+ years of experience as a UI/UX designer or a product designer (biopharma or data analytics industries are a big plus)
* A portfolio that includes complex software
* Proficiency in design tools
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
* Strong communication skills
* Ability to quickly grasp and implement new concepts in scientific domains
* Passion for applying technology to life sciences
* Intellectual curiosity, versatility, sense of ownership, and a track record of achievement

## Why join us?

* Minimal bureaucracy, maximum impact
* Freedom to organize your work
* Challenging problems with real-world implications
* Collaboration with experts across multiple disciplines
* Continuous learning in cutting-edge tech and science
* Contributions to open source and democratization of data science
