Multiple Roles | Location: Remote | Start: ASAP

While others talk about revolutionizing drug discovery, we're doing it. We've
built a platform that runs UMAP on hundreds of thousands of molecules in
seconds, not hours. Our users interactively explore the chemical space on the
entire ChEMBL database, perform complex operations like substructure searches,
and collaborate on ideas  - all in a web browser. We handle everything - from
data access and visualization to advanced ML/AI for ADMET profiling. We're
leveraging WebAssembly and WebGPU to push browser capabilities to their limits,
and CUDA and other tech on the server side. 

Our lean, global team works with top scientists to solve real-world problems,
and we're looking for developers who thrive on solving complex challenges and
delivering results. 

If you've previously developed any of these, we want to hear from you:

* Cheminformatics and/or bioinformatics apps (think molecular sketchers, sequence alignment, substructure search engines, or SAR tools)
* High-performance, web-based scientific visualizations (we think ours are best-in-class, but we're ready to be surprised)
* High-performance computing engines (not just building pipelines)
* Advanced algorithms for working with massive datasets

## Depending on your skills, you may

* Implement blazing-fast substructure search algorithms in the browser, on the server, or both
* Develop plugins for in-depth life science data analysis
* Create fit-for-purpose apps for drug discovery workflows
* Optimize GPU computations for molecular modeling
* Create interactive genomic sequence and other visualizations

## Requirements

* Strong skills in at least one of C#, Dart, C++, JS/TS. Python is a plus
* An obsession to deliver high-performant, elegant code
* Understanding of the drug discovery process and its challenges
* Passion for applying technology to life sciences
* Intellectual curiosity, versatility, sense of ownership, and a track record of achievement

## What sets you apart

* Ability to quickly grasp and implement new concepts in scientific domains
* Experience in developing high-performance, scalable enterprise solutions
* Skill in creating intuitive interfaces for complex scientific workflows
* Aptitude for optimizing algorithms and computations

## Why join us?

* Minimal bureaucracy, maximum impact
* Freedom to organize your work
* Challenging problems with real-world implications
* Collaboration with experts across multiple disciplines
* Continuous learning in cutting-edge tech and science
* Contributions to open source and democratization of data science

## Stand out from the crowd

Want to make a lasting impression? Consider submitting a short video
presentation about yourself. Show us your problem-solving skills, brag about the
things you are most proud of, and tell us how you can contribute!
