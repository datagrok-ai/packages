# Manual Test: Adding connections

## Target functionality

Data connection is used for accessing data in a particular data source. Connection parameters depend on the data source. Typically, you would need to provide server name and login credentials.

## Scenario

Read the table from the top, do not skip any steps until it is intentional, and you know what you are doing.
This scenario needs to be reproduced for different DBs (Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL, MS SQL)
