# Tests: Normalize

Performs numerical column normalization (min-max, z-scores)

## Testing scenario

1. Open "demog" table

1. Open "Normalize..." dialog for *"Age"* column (from it's context menu or from "Actions" tab
   on [Property Panel](../../datagrok/navigation.md#properties))

* "Normalize" dialog is open

1. Select categorical columns for *Column* field (*"Sex"*, *"Control"*, *"Started"*)

* Field is highlighted in red
* "OK" disabled for clicking
* Reason is shown in tooltip (column is not numerated)

1. Select *"Age"* in *Column* field and leave default method (min-max) and execute dialog

* *"Age"* column values are normalized by min-max method

1. Open "Normalize..." dialog for *"Height"* column (from it's context menu or from "Actions" tab
   on [Property Panel](../../datagrok/navigation.md#properties))

* "Normalize" dialog is open

1. Select "z-scores" for *Method* field and execute dialog

* *"Height"* column values are normalized by z-scores method

1. Open **Tools | Console** (or use hotkey "~")

* "Console"  is open
* Console shows Normalize() functions performed in previous steps

1. Execute command "Normalize("demog", "Weight")" in console

* *"Weight"* column values are normalized by min-max method
