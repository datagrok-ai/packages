# Tests: Transformation editor

[Recipe Editor](../../transform/recipe-editor.md) lets you define data
transformations. [Transformations](../../transform/recipe-editor.md) can be used as a post-run step for data queries and
data jobs, or can be executed separately. You can also share [Transformations](../../transform/recipe-editor.md) with other
users.

## Testing scenario

1. Open [Transformations Editor](../../transform/recipe-editor.md) for *stores in @state* query. (*
   PostgreSQL* provider, *starbucks* connection)

* New view [Transformations Editor](../../transform/recipe-editor.md) is added for *stores in @state*
  query
* First step of transformation is selection of query parameters.
* Table preview is empty because no parameters are defined.

1. Add "RenameColumn" action to second step

* "RenameColumn" action added
* Warning about not completed previous step

1. Determine value of parameter ```State = "NY"``` in first step of transformation

* Table preview shows data according to parameter entered. (```State = "NY"```)
* Warning for incomplete step not shown
* Second step ("RenameColumn") is active for editing
* Warning is displayed stating that "RenameColumn" action fields are not defined.
* First step is highlighted in green

1. Click on ```â–º``` icon for action "RenameColumn"

* Action fields edit area is expanded

1. Select column *"city"* in "column" field and enter value ```town``` in "New Name" field

* "RenameColumn" action step is highlighted in green
* *"city"* column name was changed to *"town"* in table preview

1. Switch to list of actions categories on [Toolbox](../../overview/navigation.md#toolbox)

1. Choose "Enrich" actions category

1. Switch back to list of actions on [Toolbox](../../overview/navigation.md#toolbox)

* Only "Enrich" category actions are shown

1. Choose "AddNewColumn" action for next step in transformation

1. Enter to "Expression" field: ```${street_address}, ${city}, ${state}``` and ```auto``` to "Name"
   field. ("Type" field leave default)

* "AddNewColumn" action step is highlighted in green
* New column *"Address"* (concatenation of *"street_address"*, *"town*" and *"state"*  columns) is added to table
  preview

1. Enter "AddressToCoordinates" in the search box on the toolbox.

* Search shows matching results as you type each character
* After full input, results show "AddressToCoordinates" action "test"

1. Add "AddressToCoordinates" action to [Transformation](../../transform/recipe-editor.md)

* "address" field in "AddressToCoordinates" action step automatically filled by *"Address*" column
* "AddressToCoordinates" action step is highlighted in green
* New columns *"latitude"* and *"longitude"* are added to table preview

1. Click on first step in [Transformation](../../transform/recipe-editor.md)

* Table preview was transferred to original

1. Delete "RenameColumn" action step

* "AddNewColumn" action step not performed, highlighted in red and warning with error is shown
* "AddressToCoordinates" action step not performed, highlighted in red and warning about previous step failed is shown

1. Edit "Expression" field: ```${street_address}, ${city}, ${state}``` for "AddNewColumn" action step

* "AddNewColumn" action step is executed and highlighted in green
* "AddressToCoordinates" action step is executed and highlighted in green (*)

1. Close [Transformations Editor](../../transform/recipe-editor.md).md view, go to "Connect to data" view

1. Select *stores in @state* query. (*PostgreSQL* provider, *starbucks* connection)
   in [Property Panel](../../overview/navigation.md#properties)

* "transformation" tab of [Property Panel](../../overview/navigation.md#properties) shows the script created earlier (**)

1. Run *stores in @state* query with value ```NY``` for @state parameter

* Table contains *"Address"*, *"latitude"* and *"longitude"* columns described in query transformation

(\*) While the algorithm is being executed (transformation step is being executed), step is highlighted in blue.
(\**)
Script: ```AddNewColumn("StoresInState", "${street_address}, ${city}, ${state}", "Address", "auto", false)
AddressToCoordinates("StoresInState", "Address")```
