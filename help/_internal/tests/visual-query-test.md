# Tests: Data query

Visual Query allows you to get table with aggregated values by columns from DB table.

## Testing scenario

1. Open "Connect to data..." tab on "Welcome" view

1. Expand ```PosgteSQL -> northwind -> Tables```

1. Open *Visual Query* for **products** DB table (from it's context menu)

* Added special "Query View" with control for selection of aggregations

1. Select "*productid"* column for "Columns" field, "*suplplierid"* column for "Rows" field and select *avg(unitprice)*
   for "Measures" field

* Preview shows result table with selected aggregations
* First column correspond to values of "*suplplierid"* column from **products** DB table
* Other columns corresponds to values of "*productid"* column from **products** DB table
* Table values corresponds to average value of "*unitprice"* column for intersection of values of "*suplplierid"*
  and "*productid"* columns

1. Click on "Run query..." action on [Toolbox](../../datagrok/navigation.md#toolbox)

* Table with result of aggregations from "Visual Query" is added to [workspace](../../datagrok/workspace.md)

1. Return to view with [Source Tree](../../access/data-source.md)

1. Click on "Get All" from context menu of **products** DB table

* Table "*products*" with all values and columns added to [workspace](../../datagrok/workspace.md)

1. Open **Data | Aggregate Rows**

1. Configure fields of [Aggregate rows](../../transform/aggregate-rows.md) dialog as in step 4

1. Execute [Aggregate rows](../../transform/aggregate-rows.md) dialog

* Result of [Aggregate rows](../../transform/aggregate-rows.md) same as result of Visual Query from step 7

1. Repeat previous steps for **PostgresNet**, **MySql**, **MS SQL**, **MariaDB**, **ORACLE**
   providers

1. Click on "Add result to workspace" from dialog menu (v)

* Result table of query from [Query Builder](../../access/query-builder.md) has been added to workspace

1. Click on "Get All" from context menu of **employees** DB table

* Table "*employees*" with all values and columns added to workspace

1. Repeat previous steps for **PostgresNet**, **MySql**, **MS SQL**, **MariaDB**, **ORACLE**
   providers
