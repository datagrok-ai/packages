# Tests: Sorting

Platform provides ability to sort data by values of columns. Supports sorting in descending, ascending, and default
order (original order from data source).

## Testing scenario

1. Open *demog* table

1. Remove multiple values from *RACE*, *STARTED* and *CONTROL* columns

* Columns of each type contains ```null``` values

1. Double click on *AGE* column

* Order of table rows has changed by decreasing values of *AGE* column
* In heading of *AGE* column shows down arrow
* Rows with ```AGE = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *AGE* column

* Order of table rows has changed by ascending values of *AGE* column
* In heading of *AGE* column shows up arrow
* Rows with ```AGE = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *AGE* column

* Order of table rows has changed to default order (original order from data source).

1. Double click on *RACE* column

* Order of table rows has changed by decreasing values of *RACE* column (by reverse alphabet)
* In heading of *RACE* column shows down arrow
* Rows with ```RACE = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *RACE* column

* Order of table rows has changed by ascending values of *RACE* column (by alphabet)
* In heading of *RACE* column shows up arrow
* Rows with ```RACE = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *RACE* column

* Order of table rows has changed to default order (original order from data source).

1. Double click on *HEIGHT* column

* Order of table rows has changed by decreasing values of *HEIGHT* column
* In heading of *HEIGHT* column shows down arrow
* Rows with ```HEIGHT = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *HEIGHT* column

* Order of table rows has changed by ascending values of *HEIGHT* column
* In heading of *HEIGHT* column shows up arrow
* Rows with ```HEIGHT = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *HEIGHT* column

* Order of table rows has changed to default order (original order from data source).

1. Double click on *CONTROL* column

* Order of table rows has changed by decreasing values of *CONTROL* column (first values ```true```)
* In heading of *CONTROL* column shows down arrow
* Rows with ```CONTROL = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *CONTROL* column

* Order of table rows has changed by ascending values of *CONTROL* column (first values ```false```)
* In heading of *CONTROL* column shows up arrow
* Rows with ```CONTROL = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *CONTROL* column

* Order of table rows has changed to default order (original order from data source).

1. Double click on *STARTED* column

* Order of table rows has changed by decreasing values of *CONTROL* column (by reverse chronology)
* In heading of *CONTROL* column shows down arrow
* Rows with ```CONTROL = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *STARTED* column

* Order of table rows has changed by ascending values of *STARTED* column (by chronology)
* In heading of *STARTED* column shows up arrow
* Rows with ```STARTED = null``` moving to bottom of table

1. Double click on *STARTED* column

* Order of table rows has changed to default order (original order from data source).

Also use context menu of columns to sorting. Submenu **Sort**. Repeat steps 3-17 using the column context menu.
