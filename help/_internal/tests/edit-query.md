# Manual Test: Edit Query

## Target functionality

Data query defines which data should be extracted from the data source. For databases, that would typically be the SQL query; for Excel file, that would be sheet name, etc. 

## Scenario

Read the table from the top, do not skip any steps until it is intentional, and you know what you are doing.
This scenario needs to be reproduced for different DBs (Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL, MS SQL)
