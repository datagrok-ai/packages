* Select [Line Chart](../../visualize/viewers/line-chart.md) from *"Add"* menu (or click
  on [Line Chart](../../visualize/viewers/line-chart.md) pic on Toolbox)

  Price"* column (right selector near Y axis)
* Select "sum" value for aggregate (left selector near Y axis)

  that corresponds to the price value equal to zero

  on [Line Chart](../../visualize/viewers/line-chart.md)
