## Caching for file shares

We've introduced caching for [file shares](../../../access/files/files.md) (including S3, Azure, and local storage):
* Faster file retrieval and display in [Browse](../../../datagrok/navigation/views/browse.md)
* Entirely browser-based cache, eliminating server requests
* Configurable caching for individual files and file shares
* Automatic cache invalidation when files are modified within the platform

[Learn more](../../../develop/how-to/function_results_cache.md).

##  Machine Learning

We continue to improve [ML capabilities](../../../learn/learn.md) within the platform:

Improved in-platform model training:
* Automatic input substitution for models
* Interactive hyperparameter tuning
* New interactive visualization widgets for model performance evaluation

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) integration ([learn more](../../../learn/mlflow.md)):
* Import and apply MLflow predictive models directly to Datagrok datasets
* Streamlined model management:
   * Automatic MLflow model fetching
   * Input annotation via MLflow tags
* MLflow models inference support
