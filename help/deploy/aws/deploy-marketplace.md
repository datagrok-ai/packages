To provide our users with the easiest way to deploy Datagrok to AWS, we integrated Datagrok with [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace). Using AWS Marketplace, you can deploy all [Datagrok components](../../develop/under-the-hood/infrastructure.md) and the required AWS infrastructure from scratch with just a few clicks. If you want to customize the deployment or use your existing infrastructure, we suggest using [CloudFormation](deploy-amazon-cloudformation.md) or [Terraform](deploy-amazon-terraform.md) options instead.

2. Choose one of the fulfillment options from the list, and click Continue to launch.

3. To start deployment, click on the **CloudFormation** deployment template. Quick create stack page opens.

4. Fulfill all parameters for the stack; they can vary depending on the chosen fulfillment option. Click Create stack. The AWS starts the deployment, and the stack has 'CREATE_IN_PROGRESS' status.

   * **Region**. CloudFormation uses current region to set up datagrok. To select another region [change region in the navigation bar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/select-region.html). 
   * **Stack name.** To meet AWS naming requirements, name must be shorter than _10 symbols_ and correspond [S3 Bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
   * **The following resource(s) require capabilities: [AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy, AWS::IAM::Role].** Datagrok creates [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) with custom names to access S3, RDS, ECS tasks. The IAM policies are very strict and allows only required operations to a limited amount of resources. You can review the policies before startup in cloudformation template using _Template URL_.

5. Wait until AWS completes the deployment. The stack status will be 'CREATE_COMPLETE.' Your Datagrok instance is now ready to use.

   If you see one of the following statuses then something went wrong: CREATE_FAILED, ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS, ROLLBACK_COMPLETE, ROLLBACK_FAILED. [Check the stack events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#basic-ts-guide) for more information about error.

   <summary>Manual DNS</summary>
   If you chose the fulfillment option with manual DNS, remember to create CNAME DNS records for CVM and Datagrok Load Balancers.
   To get the Load Balancer endpoints for DNS record:
   
   1. Go to stack Resources. Type 'LoadBalancer' in the search field. Find internet-facing load balancers: _LoadBalancerCvm_, _LoadBalancerDatagrok_. Open _Physical ID_ for LoadBalancerCvm, LoadBalancerDatagrok. A new tab with the selected load balancer opens. Copy _DNS name_.

   2. Use copied DNS names to create CNAME DNS records, for example
      * Host: datagrok.example.com, Target: LoadBalancerDatagrok DNS name
      * Host: cvm.example.com, Target: LoadBalancerCvm DNS name

   </details>

6. Enter the platform using the `admin` user. To get the password:
   1. Go to stack Resources. Type 'Cluster' in the search field. Find Datagrok Cluster: _Cluster_. Open _Physical ID_ for Cluster. A new tab with the selected cluster opens.
   2. Go to Tasks. Click on _datagrok_ task definition revision. Task definition opens.
   3. Select _datagrok_ container. From environment variables, copy the value of `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. It is a password for the first login.
   4. To increase security, [change the password for the admin user](../complete-setup/configure-auth.md) on the first login. Datagrok will ignore the admin password from environment variables on subsequent restarts.

7. If you chose the fulfillment option with _manual DNS_, you need to change CVM endpoint. On the sidebar, go to **Settings** > **Scripting**. Change the _Cvm Url Client_ to the CVM DNS record you created.
8. Your Datagrok platform is now ready to use. Configure [authentication](../complete-setup/configure-auth.md), [SMTP](../complete-setup/configure-smtp.md), [install-packages](../complete-setup/install-packages.md). And enjoy fast and flexible data analysis.
