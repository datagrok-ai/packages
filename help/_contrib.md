# Contributor's guide to help

We are following [Microsoft Style Guide][100].

Points to pay most attention to are provided in this document.

## Titles

We use [sentence-style capitalization][101] for headers and articles' names:

* **Not correct**: Building Custom Information Panels
* **Correct**: Building custom information panels

## Line wrapping

We wrap lines in `.md` files at 100 characters.

**Motivation:**

1. Explicit wrapping helps track changes in commits and diffs
2. 100 characters limit helps fit the two `.md` files side-by-side on a 1080p screen in a diff window or when making
   synchronous edits in two files

## Proper names

We capitalize proper names of distinct UI functional elements:

* **Not correct**: Navigate to a property panel
* **Acceptable**: Navigate to the Property Panel
* **Correct**: Navigate to Property Panel

We don't capitalize functional elements which can exist in plurality:

* **Not correct**: Open Information Panel
* **Correct**: Open an information panel, in the information panel select an item
