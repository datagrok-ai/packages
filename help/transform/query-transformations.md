title: "Query transformations"
---

After the data is retrieved from the data provider, it can be transformed using functions.

There are several ways to add transformations:

* Edit table as you normally would.
* Add steps manually from toolbox.
* Use table context menu

All data transformations done via the UI are recorded as macros, and can be replayed.
