# Tests: Anonymize data

Sometimes, it is needed to prepare a dataset that conveys an idea of the structure in the data along with the patterns
in it, but does not contain the real data points. "[Anonymize Data](anonymize-data.md)" functionality can be handy here.

## Testing scenarios

1. Open "demog" dataset

1. Open "Anonymize Data..." dialog from  **Tools** menu

1. Select a numerical column "Age"

1. Click "OK" button

* Values in the "Age" column changed with the randomization factor equal to 0.1 (
  default value)

1. Anonymize data of string column "Sex"

* Values ​​in the "Sex" column have changed to "Sex 0" and "Sex 1"

1. Use different values in "Number randomization factor" field (negatives, integers, floats) for anonymize data of "
   Height" field

* Values ​​in the "Height" column are changed according to the randomization factor

1. Test non-functional modules (UI, popup menu, help, navigation, properties, etc.)

* Non-functional modules work correctly and are intuitive
