1. Enter more than one character to "Split by" field. Mark "Consecutive as one"

* Embedded characters are treated as one delimiter

1. Enter more than one character to "Split by" field. Mark "By chars"

* Splitting is carried out for each entered character

1. Click on "History" button and return previous states
