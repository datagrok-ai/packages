# Word list

## allow, enable

Try to avoid _allow_ and _enable_ unless you are talking about security-related features.

| Instead of                                          | Use        |
|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----------|
|This feature allows you to save a view as a template |You can save a view as a template|

This phrasing is from the user's perspective (action-oriented) rather than the person who implemented the feature.

## alpha/beta

Lowercase. Example: The XYZ feature is in alpha.

## backend (not back-end or back end)

## below/above

When referring to a place in a documentation page, use _following_ instead of _below_ and _preceding_ or _earlier_ instead of _above_.

## CI/CD

CI/CD is always uppercase. No need to spell it out on first use.

## click (not click on)

Do not use _click_ with buttons, links, menu items, and lists. Instead, use _select_. _Select_ applies to more devices, while _click_ is more specific to a mouse. If you must use _click_, use _click_, not _click on_.

## collapse

Use _collapse_ instead of _close_ when you are talking about expanding or collapsing a section in the UI.

## checkbox (not check box)

## data

In our usage, data is singular, not plural. Say _the data is_, not _the data are_. Also, in our usage, data is a mass noun, not a count noun. For example, say _less data_ rather than _fewer data_.

## data center (not datacenter)

## data cleaning (not data cleansing)

## data flow (noun); dataflow (noun)

If you can replace the noun with the phrase _flow of data_, then use two words: _data flow_. If you can't, use one word: _dataflow_.

## dataset (not data set)

## data source (not datasource)

## datastore (not data store)

## deprecate

To deprecate an item is to recommend against the item's use, typically as a warning that the item will soon be unavailable or unsupported. Don't use deprecated to mean _removed_, _deleted_, _shut down_, or _turned down_.

## dialog (not dialog box)

## dropdown list (not dropdown, drop-down, dropdown menu, or other variants)

## email (not e-mail, Email, or E-mail)

## enter versus type

In most cases, use _enter_ rather than _type_. _Enter_ encompasses multiple ways to enter information, including speech and keyboard. _Enter_ also assumes that the user puts a value in a field and then moves the cursor outside the field (or presses the Enter button). _Enter_ includes both the entering of the content and the action to validate the content.

## field

Use _box_ instead of _field_ or _text box_. However, you can use _fields_ when referring to all fields at once. For example:

* An **Embed** dialog appears. Fill in the fields.

## fill in; fill out

* When referring to entering information in individual fields, use _fill in_.
* When referring to completing an entire form, use _fill out_.

_Example:_ Fill out the questionnaire. Be sure to fill in the required fields.

## frontend (not front-end)

## GIF

Don't use a filetype extension to refer to a type of file. For example, use _GIF file_ rather than _.gif file_.

## heatmap/treemap (not heat map/tree map)

## hover

Use when the user needs to hold their mouse over a UI element, but not click the UI element.

## Markdown

Always capitalized.

## markup (noun), mark up (verb)

No hyphen. As a verb, it's two words.

## metadata (not meta-data)

## on

When documenting how to select high-level UI elements, use the word _on_ (instead of _in_ or _from_).

_Example:_ On the left **Sidebar**, select **Settings**.

## open source (no hyphen, not even as an adjective or verb)

## plugin (noun), plug-in (adjective), plug in (verb)

## pop-up, popup

Don't use. Instead, use _dialog_ to describe a window that appears and asks for, or presents, additional information. Use _menu_ for menus that rise from an interface.

## scatterplot (not scatter plot)
