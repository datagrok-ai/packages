## Our approach to documentation

### Documentation is the single source of truth

Our wiki is a single source of truth for any information about how to deploy, use, or troubleshoot Datagrok. This policy applies to how we communicate and share knowledge internally and externally. The rationale is simple. We want to have all information about Datagrok in a place that is universally accessible to prevent information silos, knowledge gaps, and inefficiencies.

For this reason, we maintain our documentation in a [public repository on Github](link). To learn how to become a contributor, see [Contribute to documentation](link).

We encourage anyone to share their knowledge through a wiki article, a post on a [community forum](link), or a YouTube video. The more information we add, the more we help others accomplish tasks faster and better and solve problems.

### Use fewer words, better

Don't overwhelm documentation users with information. [Use concise and clear language](link) and follow the guidelines for [content types](link). Rather than repeating information from another topic, link to it instead.
