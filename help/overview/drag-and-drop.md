# Drag-and-drop

Datagrok lets almost all objects be drag-and-dropped, which makes a lot of interactions more intuitive. As soon as a
user starts dragging an object, all possible drop zones get highlighed.

Here are some of commonly used drag-and drop operations:

* [Variables view](navigation.md#variables)
* Columns
    * Rearrange grid column order (drag by the grid column header)
    * Drag into [Add New Column](../transform/add-new-column.md) dialog
    * Drag into [Add New Column](../transform/add-new-column.md) dialog

## Drag-and-dropping columns

Drag-and-dropping columns is an intuitive way to choose columns on viewers, or perform operations on them. A number of
controls can be used as a source of drag-and-drop:
[Grid](../visualize/viewers/grid.md), [Column Manager](../explore/column-manager.md)
, [Table Manager](../overview/table-manager.md)
Most of the viewers, and a lot of dialogs accept columns that are being dragged.
