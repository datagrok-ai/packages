# Tests: workspace

[Workspace](workspace.md) is a collection of currently opened [projects](project.md).

[Workspace](workspace.md) Tree is a hierarchical viewer that is used for navigating and
managing [projects](project.md),
[tables](table.md), [connections](../access/data-connection.md), and other entities.

## Testing scenarios

1. Open *"demog"* [project](project.md)

1. Open "[Workspace](workspace.md)" via **View | Workspace** (or ```Alt + W```)

* [Workspace](workspace.md) is opened, in which empty Skrachpad and *"
  demog"* [project](project.md)

1. Expand *"demog"* in [Workspace](workspace.md)

* In *"demog"* branch there are subelements tables and view next to which number of internal elements is displayed (1)

1. Expand *"Tables"*

* There is one table *"demog"*

1. Call context menu for table *"demog"*

* "Add view" - add new view for table
* "Remove" - remove table from [project](project.md)
* "Open in Jupyter" - create "Jupyter Notebook" for table
* "Save as CSV" - save table to .csv file
* "Rename" - rename table
* "Clone" - create copy of table
* "Save as [project](project.md)"
* "Exclude from [project](project.md)" - exclude table from [project](project.md). Table will be moved
  to [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md)

1. Expand table *"demog"*

* Here are tabs *"Tags"* and *"Columns"*
* In "Columns" you can see columns tags and columns stats
* From context menu for columns, you can perform the operations "Rename", "Remove", "Extract", "
  Change type", "Extract numbers" (for sting type columns)

1. Expand "View" tab for [project](project.md) *"demog"*

* Here are Table Views for all tables in [project](project.md)
* You can remove view from its context menu

1. To add entities (queries, connections, data jobs, models, scripts, notebooks)
   to [project](project.md), you can drag them from any location directly to [project](project.md)
   branch in [Workspace](workspace.md)

* After adding entity to [project](project.md), all available operations on them can be performed from their context
  menu in [project](project.md) tree
* Any entity can be excluded from [project](project.md). After that, it will be transferred to
  [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md)

1. Open *"cars.csv"* file from local storage

* File "cars.csv" is open
* Table and view for it are added to [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md)

1. Drag *"cars"* table from [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md) to *"demog"* [project](project.md)

* Table *"cars"* added to [project](project.md) *"demog"* and no longer exists in [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md)
* Corresponding view was moved along with table in *"demog"* [project](project.md)

1. Choose *"Exclude"* from context menu of *"demog"* table in *"demog"* [project](project.md)

* Table *"demog"* added to [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md) and no longer exists in *"
  demog"* [project](project.md)
* Corresponding view was moved along with table in [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md)

1. Click on [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md) or on its internal elements. Then click on *"Upload"*
   button (or use context menu for upload)

* "Create a project" dialog is open
* New [project](project.md) open after uploading
* All elements of [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md) have moved to new [project](project.md)

1. Click on *"demog"* [project](project.md) or on its internal elements. Then click on *"Save"*
   button (or use context menu for save)

* [project](project.md) *"demog"* is reuploaded with changes

1. Click on *"Close others"* item in context menu for [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md)

* All [projects](project.md) are closed
