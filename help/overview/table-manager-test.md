# Tests: Table Manager

["Table Manager"](table-manager.md), available via **View | Tables**, contains a list of currently open tables. Use it
to navigate between tables, select them, or perform batch actions. It also allows to view metadata on multiple tables in
a tabular format.

The implementation is based on the [grid](../visualize/viewers/grid.md), so many of the grid's features apply.

## Testing scenarios

1. Open two [tables](table.md)

1. Open "Table" dialog via **View | Tables** (or ```Alt + T```)

1. Click on first [table](table.md) in ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md) then click on second table

* When selecting a [table](table.md) from the ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md), tab with the selected table opens
* Selected [table](table.md) in ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md) is displayed
  on [Property Panel](../overview/navigation.md#properties)

1. Call context menu for [table](table.md) in ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)

* Submenu is displayed that refers to selected [table](table.md) (tittle like table name), as well as common submenus
  for all tables ("Show", "Save as table")
* There are items "Add view", "Remove" "Open in Jupyter", "Save as CSV", "Rename", "Clone", "Save as project" in submenu
  for selected [table](table.md), which work correctly

1. Click on "Save as table" item in context menu

* New tab has been created with [table](table.md) in which information from
  ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)
* New row has been created in ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md) corresponding to new table

1. With ```Shift``` held down, select all three tables from ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)

* In context menu, submenu appears whose actions apply to all selected tables (tittle is "3 tables")
* [Property Panel](../overview/navigation.md#properties) displays actions related to all selected tables

1. Expand "Show" submenu from the context menu

* Submenu "Show" shows tables attributes to be added to ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)
* There is item for adding all attributes ("All")

1. Click on "All" item from "Show" submenu from the context menu

* All tables attributes are added to ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)
* "All" item and and all attributes in list marked with icon "✓"
* If attribute is not available for a specific [table](table.md), the corresponding cell is empty

1. Click on "All" item from "Show" submenu from the context menu again

* Tables attributes are no longer displayed in ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)
* "All" item and all attributes are no longer marked with icon "✓"

1. Alternately add individual [table](table.md) attributes

* When you add [table](table.md) attribute, corresponding column is added to ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md)
* Added [table](table.md) attribute is marked with icon "✓" in the list
* When you click on [table](table.md) attribute again - corresponding column is deleted from
  ["Table Manager"](table-manager.md) and icon "✓" for it no longer displayed

1. Test non-functional features (help, navigation, working with window, etc.)

* Non-functional modules work correctly and are intuitive
