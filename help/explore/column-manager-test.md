# Tests: Column Manager

[Column Manager](column-manager.md), available via **View | Columns**, contains a list of columns in the currently open
tables. Use it to navigate between columns, select them, or perform batch actions. It also allows to view metadata on
multiple columns in a tabular format, as well as other column properties, such as statistics.

The implementation is based on the [grid](../visualize/viewers/grid.md), so many of the grid's features apply.

## Testing scenario

1. Open demog.csv

1. Open "Columns manager" via **View | Tables** (or ```Alt + C```)

1. Alternately click on columns in ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)

* Selected column is highlighted in [table](../overview/table.md)
* Selected column is shown on [Property Panel](../overview/navigation.md#properties)

1. Call context menu for column in ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)

* Submenu is displayed that refers to selected column (tittle like *'column name' + "column"*, eg. *'Age' column*), as
  well as "Add stats" submenu for all columns
* There are items "Remove", "Rename" "Extract", "Change type", "Rename" in submenu for selected column, which work
  correctly

1. With ```Shift``` held down, select all columns from ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)

* In context menu, submenu appears whose actions apply to all selected columns (tittle like *"n selected columns"*)
* [Property Panel](../overview/navigation.md#properties) displays actions related to all selected columns

1. Expand "Add stats" submenu from the context menu

* Submenu "Add stats" shows tree blocks of columns attributes to be added to ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)
* First block contains items "All" (for add all attributes), "Selected" and "Filtered", which work correctly
* Second block with "Histogram" item for add the histogram for numerical columns (for non-numeric columns cells are
  empty)
* Third block contains standart columns stats (min, max, avg, etc.)

1. Click on "All" item from "Add stats" submenu from the context menu

* All colimns attributes are added to ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)
* "All" item and and all attributes in list marked with icon "✓"
* If attribute is not available for a specific column, the corresponding cell is empty

1. Click on "All" item from "Add stats" submenu from the context menu again

* Attributes are no longer displayed in ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)
* "All" item and all attributes are no longer marked with icon "✓"

1. Alternately add individual column attributes from all blocks

* When you add column attribute, corresponding column is added to ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)
* Added column attribute is marked with icon "✓" in the list
* When you click on attribute again - corresponding column is deleted from ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md) and
  icon "✓" for it no longer displayed

1. Open ["Aggregate Rows"](../transform/aggregate-rows.md) dialog. Drag columns
   from ["Column Manager"](column-manager.md)
   to ["Aggregate Rows"](../transform/aggregate-rows.md) dialog fields

* ["Aggregate Rows"](../transform/aggregate-rows.md) dialog fields are filled with dragged columns
* In the same way, test the ability to drag and drop into all dialogs and [viewers](../visualize/viewers.md) that it
  supports

1. Test non-functional features (help, navigation, working with window, etc.)

* Non-functional modules work correctly and are intuitive
