# Tests: Cluster data

[Clustering](cluster-data.md) is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group
(called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other

## Testing scenarios:

1. Open "demog" dataset

1. Open "Cluster..." from  **Tools | Data Science**

1. Add "Age", "Height" and "Weight" columns to field "Features"

1. Enter the number of [clusters](cluster-data.md) equal to 3 in the field "Clusters"

1. Set the value of field "Show scatter plot" as true

* Column "clusters" was added to "demog" table
* Viewer "[Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)" was created where [clusters](cluster-data.md) are marked
  with color

1. Click on "Cancel" button in "Cluster" dialog

* Column "clusters" and [scatter plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) disappeared

1. Add all available columns to field "Features"

1. Click "OK" button

* Column "clusters" was added to "demog" table

1. Test non-functional modules (UI, popup menu, help, navigation, properties, etc.)

* Non-functional modules work correctly and are intuitive
