# Files

File shares are often used for storing and exchanging data, and Datagrok provides first-class support for them. Once a
file share is mounted as a network drive on a server and registered within the platform, its content gets
automatically [indexed](../../access/files-indexer.md)
and can be browsed.

Our indexing mechanism understands
[most popular file formats](../../access/importing-data.md#supported-file-types), including archives such as .tar or
.zip, or Excel files. This enables powerful browsing. For instance, you can quickly browse columns in a particular data
sheet in an Excel file that resides within a zip file.

In addition to browsing, it is also possible to search for tables using [metadata](../../discover/metadata.md) that gets
extracted during the indexing process. For example, you might want to find tables that were created in the last month
that have at least two columns, one of them containing molecules and another named "activity". It is also possible to
perform such a search across all (or specified) data providers (
including relational databases, etc) at once.
