* (1) If you want to use parameterized queries, you need to add `ALLOW FILTERING`
  which can lead to sirius performance penalties. Moreover, to be able to use string patterns you need to create secondary indexes for columns in where clause.
  See [documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.3/cql/cql_reference/cqlSelect.html).
