title: "Supported connectors"
---

A connector can work with a database, an Excel file, a CSV file, a web service,
or basically anything that is capable of providing the data. Datagrok currently
supports over 30 different connectors, and the list is quickly growing. Most of
Datagrok’s data connectors are open-sourced and could be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/connectors) (MIT
license). The supported connectors with their specific parameters are the
following:

| Data Source                                         | Server | Port | DB  | Cache Schema | Cache Results | SSL | Connection String | Login | Password | Other Parameters                                                          |
