title: "Query View"
---

An integrated environment for working with [data queries](access.md#data-query).

To run query, press F5. Results will appear at the bottom of the screen. Switch to the "
Transformations" tab to add post-processing steps if needed.

Give it a name, and save the query to use it later.

Typically, a query is used against a database, however the same concepts apply for other data sources that are listed
below:

| Data source          | Query      |
|----------------------|------------|
| Relational databases | SQL        |
| File share           | Filename   |
| Excel file           | Sheet name |
| Linked data          | SPARQL     |
| Box                  | Filename   |
