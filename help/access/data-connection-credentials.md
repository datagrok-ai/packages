When you [add a data connection](databases.mdx#adding-connection) you can use Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager to store, manage, and retrieve secrets. Alternatively, you can use the [Datagrok's Credentials Management Service](../govern/security.md#credentials).

## Setting up connection with AWS Secrets Manager

Prerequisites:

* In Datagrok:
  * A user role with _create connections_ and _edit connections_ privileges.
* In AWS:
  * An existing secret. For information on how to create a secret, see [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html).
  * Permissions that allow you to view secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

To use the AWS Secrets Manager in a database connection, follow these steps:

* _Step 1_. Set up a connection to the AWS Secrets Manager.
  1. Go to **Data > Databases**.
  1. In the **Toolbox** under **Actions**, select **Add new connectionâ€¦** to open the **Add new connection** dialog.
  1. In the dialog under the **Data Source**, select **AWS** from the list of options.

  :::note

  You can set up connections to the AWS Secrets Managers for different user groups. Each connection has its own set of credentials which are stored in the Cloud Manager and which are identified by the specified Datagrok connection name and the Secret Name. The Secret Name is defined within the AWS Secrets Manager.

  1. Click **Test** to test the connection, then click **OK** to save it. If the connection fails, verify your connection details and that you added Datagrok's IP addresses to your allowlist.
