| Random walk | N columns; each row value differs from a previous one by a small delta |
| Biosensor   | Simulates biosensor signal (3-axis accelerometer, temperature and EDA  |
| Plate       | Experimental plate data: barcode, row, col, volume                     |
| Demog       | Synthetic demographics data                                            |
