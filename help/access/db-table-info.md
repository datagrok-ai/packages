# Database table

Because this table resides in an external database, the analysis is less interactive compared to the already imported
tables. There are few options for working with it:

* "Visual Query..." - lets you visually edit the query against that table, including aggregations, filters, pivots, and
  other conditions.
* "Get All" - retrieves all data. Depending on the table size, it might take a lot of time and memory
* "New SQL Query..." - starts editing a SQL query.
* "Build Query..." - opens a dialog for joining this table with the others in this schema. Uses foreign keys information
  for building the UI.
