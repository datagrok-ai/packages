# File previews

The file exploration view can not only work with tabular data, but also supports custom visualizers for file types, and
also a number of different processors. For instance, if we select and R file, we can see that not only the text of that
file is previewed, but also that the contents of the file are color-coded. If we select an image, we'll also see its
preview.

As for text files, it is also possible to edit them.

In general, it is possible to provide an external viewer or editor to any file.
