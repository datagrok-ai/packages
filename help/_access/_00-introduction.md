# Data access

Understanding the data starts with retrieving that data in some way. This is where Datagrok helps you. In short,
Datagrok provides access to anything that is machine-readable. That includes all sort of major databases, relational
databases, non-relational and NoSQL databases, flat files from a local computer, network file shares and cloud storages
such as Dropbox.

Additionally, Datagrok can easily connect to web services. That could be done in multiple flavors. If a web services
with an [OpenAPI][] support is provided, Datagrok can connect to it automatically. For anything else, writing some
custom JavaScript is required to connect using REST API and other transports.

Datagrok works natively with lots of existing popular data formats, such as CSV, TXT, JSON, and others. It can also work
with tons of scientific formats. The platform has a system that can natively extend it to understand the very custom
formats. This is very handy especially in the areas of life sciences, such as bioinformatics.

For relational databases, Datagrok allows to connect to them visually, interrogate their schema, browse the content of
the database, and visually build queries (SQL or SparQL). Datagrok can also connect to lots of publicly available
databases, such as Chembl or Unichem, and this list is growing.

Finally, everything could be automated. For instance, there is a macro that is being generated automatically while you
operate in the platform, and can be replayed at any time, so that all the data ingestion and transformation steps that
you are performing could be scripted and replayed back at any time.

There is also a concept of a data job, so that the data transformation steps on the way to a visual dashboard could be
neatly arranged as a diagram and later managed and extended.

Generating data from arbitrary functions or scripts in Python and R, which are in turn functions as well, is also
possible.
