title: "Execute script"
---

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/browser-window';
```


First of all, a script can be executed right from the script editor,
as described in [run script section](./find-script.mdx).

Script is Datagrok [function](/help/datagrok/concepts/functions/functions.md), 
and can be invoked in different ways:

- From the [Datagrok console](/help/datagrok/navigation/panels/panels.md#console)
- From the data job
- From the [transformations editor](/help/transform/recipe-editor.md)
- From the [function browser](https://public.datagrok.ai/functions)

Registered scripts can be called via [JavaScript API](/help/develop/packages/js-api.md) in the following manner:

```javascript
const result = grok.functions.call(
  "<PACKAGE_NAME>:<SCRIPT_NAME>", 
  { 
    <INPUT_NAME>: <INPUT_VALUE>,
    <INPUT_NAME_2>: <INPUT_VALUE_2>
  }
);
```

:::caution

The single output will be assigned to `result` directly. Multiple outputs will be united into a single object.
You can retrieve any output value by accessing `result` object fields (e.g. `result['<MY_OUTPUT>']`).
