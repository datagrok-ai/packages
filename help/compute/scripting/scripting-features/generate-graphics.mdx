title: "Generate graphics"
---

Datagrok supports the special data type to transfer graphical data.

For Python, this variable can contain any graph created by the
`matplotlib` library (the `matplotlib.figure.Fugure` class).
When you run the script manually, Datagrok captures the graphics object
and creates a separate tab to view the results.
Datagrok can also save the `graphics` output in a dataframe,
or display it in the cell properties.

:::tip Datagrok Viewers
Out-of-the-box Datagrok contains many flexible interactive
[viewers](../visualize/viewers/viewers.md),
suitable for almost all data visualization tasks.

We suggest you exploring it before implementing custom graphs.
