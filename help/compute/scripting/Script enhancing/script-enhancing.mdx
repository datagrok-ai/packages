```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/browser-window';
```

You may customize the script view using additional GUI-related options.
Most of them are hints to improve the interface for your scripts.
You should list options in curly braces in corresponding header lines.
The order of the hints makes no difference. All options are optional.
