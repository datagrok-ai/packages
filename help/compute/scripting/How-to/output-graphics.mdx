title: "Graphics output"
---

The script in the [previous section](#semantic-types)
returns the `graphics` object.
This is a special data type to transfer graphs from scripts to Datagrok.
For `Python`, this variable can contain any graph created by the
`Matplotlib` library (the `matplotlib.figure.Fugure` class).
When you run the script manually, Datagrok captures the graphics object
and creates a separate tab to view the results.
Datagrok can also save the `graphics` output in a dataframe,
or display it in the cell properties.

:::tip Datagrok Viewers
Out-of-the-box Datagrok contains many flexible interactive
[viewers](../visualize/viewers/viewers.md),
suitable for almost all data visualization tasks.

We suggest you exploring it before implementing custom graphs.
