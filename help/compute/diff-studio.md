![Diff Studio Sharing](pics/diff-studio-sharing-url.gif)

By using a URL, you can share model runs from the **Templates**, **Examples** and **Recent** groups.

### Sensitivity analysis

Explore the relationship between inputs and outputs of your model using the [Sensitivity Analysis](compute.md#sensitivity-analysis) feature. Run it directly from Diff Studio:

* Click <i class="fas fa-analytics"></i> **Run sensitivity analysis** icon
* Apply one of the following methods:
  * [Monte Carlo](compute.md#monte-carlo)
  * [Sobol](compute.md#sobol)
  * [Grid](compute.md#grid)
* Analyze model evaluations

![Run Sens Analysis](pics/diff-studio-run-sens-analysis.gif)

### Parameter Optimization

Find input conditions leading to the specified output constraints using the [Parameter Optimization](compute.md#input-parameter-optimization) feature. It finds input values that minimize deviation measured by [loss function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function). Run it directly from Diff Studio:

* Click <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> **Run fitting inputs** icon
* In the `Fit` block, use switchers to specify inputs to be found:
  * Set `min` and `max` values for each selected item. They define the variation range
  * Set values of all other inputs
* In the `Target` block, specify output constraints:
  * Set dataframe with expected output values (in the table input)
  * Set column with values of the independent variable (in the `argument` field)
* Specify settings of fitting:
  * Choose numerical optimization method (in the `method` field), and set loss function type (in the `loss` field)
  * Specify number of points to be found (in the `samples` field)
  * Set the maximum scaled deviation between similar fitted points (in the `similarity` field): the higher the value, the fewer points will be found
* Click <i class="fas fa-play"></i> **Run fitting** icon. You will get a [grid](../visualize/viewers/grid) containing
  * loss function values
  * fitted inputs
  * [line charts](../visualize/viewers/line-chart) visualizing the goodness of fit and showing the loss function minimization
* Open `Context panel` (F4). You will get the simulation run corresponding to the selected grid row

## Creating a custom differential equation model

### Basic model

A minimal model defining and solving ordinary differential equations contains
*name*, *differential equations*, *initial values* and *argument* specifications.

Use the `#name` keyword to define the name of your model:

```python
#name: Problem1
```

Place differential equations in the `#equations` block. You can add as many equations as you want.
Diff Studio automatically recognizes all identifiers that you use.
You can use one-letter or multi-letter identifiers.

```python
#equations:
  dx/dt = x + y + exp(t)
  dy/dt = x - y - cos(t)
```

Define the argument, its *initial* value, *final* value, and grid *step* in the `#argument` block.
Datagrok provides a numerical solution within the range *[initial, final]* with the specified grid *step*.

```python
#argument: t
  initial = 0
  final = 1
  step = 0.01
```

Define initial values of the functions in the `#inits` block:

```python
#inits:
  x = 2
  y = 5
```

### Advanced model

Use the advanced features to improve your model.

Use `#comment` block to write a comment in any place of your model

```python
#comment:
  You can provide any text here. Diff Studio just ignores it.
```

Place comments right in formulas using `//`

```python
#equations:
  dx/dt = x + y + exp(t) // 1-st equation
  dy/dt = x - y - cos(t) // 2-nd equation
```

Specify constants in the `#constants` block and parameters in the `#parameters` block.

Diff Studio treats `constants` and `parameters` exactly the same way.
However, when you [export equations](#platform-script-generation) to the platform script,
Diff Studio creates input UI only for `parameters` and leave `constants` hardcoded inside the script.

```python
#constants:
  C1 = 1
  C2 = 3

#parameters:
  P1 = 1
  P2 = -1
```

Define auxiliary computations in the `#expressions` block.
The **expression** is any mathematical function containing constants, parameters, argument, and other functions.
The only difference is that `expressions` functions are defined directly
and don't require solving of differential equations.
You can use expressions to separate part of the calculations and simplify your differential equations.

```python
#expressions:
  E1 = C1 * t + P1
  E2 = C2 * cos(2 * t) + P2
```

To customize the computation output, select columns and their captions in the `output` block:

```python
#output:
  t {caption: Time, h}
  A1 {caption: Central}
  A2 {caption: Periferal}
```

![Customize output](pics/diff-studio-output.gif)

Set [tolerance](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter19.02-Tolerance.html) of the numerical method in the `#tolerance`-line:

```python
#tolerance: 0.00005
```

### Cyclic process simulation

Datagrok provides special capabilities for modeling cyclic processes.

Use the `#loop` feature to specify several modeling cycles.
Define the number of repetitions in the mandatory `count` variable and
use any mathematical expression to modify functions and parameters.
You can set new values for parameters and change values for functions.

```python
#equations:
  dy/dt = -y + sin(N*t) / t

#parameters:
  N = 1
  
#loop:
  count = 3
  N += 2
```

![Multi-stage model - loop](pics/diff-studio-loop.gif)

### Multistage model

Use the `#update` feature to construct models with multiple sequential processes (stages).

Add name of the first stage in the `#argument` block:

```python
#argument: t, 1-st stage
  t0 = 0.01
  t1 = 15
  h = 0.01
```

Add the `#update` block. Enter name of the stage and set its duration. Add lines with model inputs updates. Use any valid mathematical expression to define them.

```python
#update: 2-nd stage
  duration = 23
  p = p * 2
```

You can add any number of `update` blocks. Simulation stages are marked with a color:

![Multi-stage model - update](pics/diff-studio-update.gif)

## Usability improvements

For all Diff Studio parameters, you can add annotations described in
[functional annotations](../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md).
When you convert your model into the Datagrok script,
Diff Studio converts it to the script input annotations,
allowing Datagrok to automatically create rich and self-explaining UI.

Define the desired captions for the input parameters.
If no caption is provided, Datagrok will use variable name.

```python
#argument: t
  start = 0 {caption: Initial time}
  finish = 2 {caption: Final time}
  step = 0.01 {caption: Calculation step}
```

Group inputs by specifying their `category`:

```python
#parameters:
  P1 = 1 {category: Parameters}
  P2 = -1 {category: Parameters}
```

Add `units`:

```python
#inits:
  x = 2 {units: C; category: Initial values}
  y = 0 {units: C; category: Initial values}
```

Provide tooltips in brackets `[ ]`:

```python
  P1 = 1 {category: Parameters} [P1 parameter tooltip]
```

Specify `min`, `max` and `step` values to get sliders and clickers for the rapid model exploration:

```python
#inits:
  x = 2 {min: 0; max: 5}
  y = 0 {min: -2; max: 2; step: 0.1}
```

The `Chem react` example simulates deterministic [mass-action kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action) given in the network

![add-to-workspace](pics/diff-studio-chem-react-network.png)

This example illustrates annotation of model inputs.

### Robertson model

Robertson’s chemical reaction model is a well-known example of [stiff equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation). It describes the process

![add-to-workspace](pics/diff-studio-robertson-network.png)

Numerical solution of stiff problems is a complicated task. Diff Studio provides solution of both stiff and non-stiff equations.

### Fermentation

The `Fermentation` example illustrates the kinetics of the biochemical reactions in [fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation).

![add-to-workspace](pics/diff-studio-fermentation.gif)

### PK

[Pharmacokinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) (PK) studies how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes drugs over time. The `PK` example simulates this process. It demonstrates the usage of the `meta.solver` feature for numerical [solver management](#solver-settings).

![add-to-workspace](pics/diff-studio-pk.png)

### PK-PD

PK-PD modeling simulates pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and their [relationship](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7348046). It is used in drug discovery and development. The `PK-PD` example illustrates the usage of the `loop` feature for dosing specification

![add-to-workspace](pics/diff-studio-pk-pd.gif)

### Acid production

`Acid production` models gluconic acid [production](https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/9919/1/Elqotbi_9919.pdf) by Aspergillus niger. This example shows the usage of the `update` feature for multistage simulation

### Pollution

The `Pollution` example describes a chemical reaction part of the air [pollution model](https://archimede.uniba.it/~testset/problems/pollu.php). It consists of 25 reaction and 20 reacting compounds. This example illustrates the capability of Diff Studio to solve large systems of [stiff equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation).

![add-to-workspace](pics/diff-studio-pollution.png)

Datagrok's ODEs suite has tools for solving both stiff and non-stiff equations. Combine Diff Studio
with [viewers](../visualize/viewers/viewers.md) and [compute](compute.md) tools to explore complex models.

## Platform script generation

You can convert any Diff Studio project to the Datagrok script:

* Click the **JS** button on the top panel
* Click the **SAVE** button to save generated script

Find the created Javascript script in the platform `Scripts`.

Use `#tags: model` to add your model to the `Model Catalog`.
Provide a description in the `#description` line:

```python
#name: Bioreaction
#tags: model
#description: Complex bioreaction simulation
```

The export feature provides an extension of your project with [scripting](scripting/scripting.mdx) tools. Apply it to get:

* non-elementary and special functions' use
* Datagrok packages' functions call

## Solver settings

Manage the solver of ODEs to improve performance. Specify its settings in the `#meta.solver`-line:

* the numerical method (`method`)
* the maximum number of iterations (`maxIterations`)
* the maximum computation time (`maxTimeMs`)

Diff Studio implements the following [Rosenbrock–Wanner](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2015.03.010) methods for solving ODEs:

|Method|Value|
|-------------|--------|
|The modified Rosenbrock triple|`'mrt'`|
|The ROS3PRw method|`'ros3prw'`|
|The ROS34PRw method|`'ros34prw'`|

By default, Diff Studio uses ROS34PRw and alerts you if computations take too long. The default time limit is 5 seconds. To customize it, set the maximum computation time (in milliseconds):

```python
#meta.solver: {method: 'mrt'; maxTimeMs: 50}
```

Set the maximum number of iterations to debug formulas in complex models.
