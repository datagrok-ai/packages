Differential equations are crucial in modeling complex systems - from pharmacology and drug manufacturing to financial modeling and environmental studies.

**Datagrok Diff Studio** solves [initial value problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem) for [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) (ODEs) and visualizes solutions in real time. You can create mathematical models with auto-generated interactive interfaces or use existing models to analyze your systems. Diff Studio is a tool for:

* **Model users**
  * Instantly see how parameter changes affect your system
  * Find optimal parameter values that match your target data
  * Explore model behavior using Monte Carlo, Sobol, and other methods
* **Model creators**
  * Start quick with pre-built models
  * Focus on math - let the platform handle the UI
  * Solve both stiff and non-stiff equations
  * Handle complex multi-equation ODE systems
  * Debug equations easily
* **Enterprises**
  * Save models as scripts to extend functionality and integrate with other Datagrok tools
  * Use as a central hub for ODE models
  * Develop custom scientific computing applications

By using URL, you can share model runs from the **Templates**, **Examples** and **Recent** groups.

### Parameter fitting

Find input conditions leading to the specified output constraints using the [Parameter Optimization](function-analysis.md#parameter-optimization) feature. It finds input values that minimize deviation measured by [loss function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function). Run it directly from Diff Studio:

1. Click the **Fit** icon on the top panel. **Fitting View** opens
2. In the `Fit` block, use switchers to specify inputs to be found:
   * Set `min` and `max` values for each selected item. They define the variation range
   * Set values of all other inputs
3. In the `Target` block, specify output constraints:
   * Set dataframe with expected output values (in the table input)
   * Set column with values of the independent variable (in the `argument` field)
4. Specify settings of fitting:
   * Choose numerical optimization method (in the `method` field), and set loss function type (in the `loss` field)
   * Specify number of points to be found (in the `samples` field)
   * Set the maximum scaled deviation between similar fitted points (in the `similarity` field): the higher the value, the fewer points will be found
5. Click <i class="fas fa-play"></i> **Run fitting** icon. You will get a [grid](../visualize/viewers/grid) containing
   * loss function values
   * fitted inputs
   * [line charts](../visualize/viewers/line-chart) visualizing the goodness of fit and showing the loss function minimization
6. Open `Context panel` (F4). You will get the simulation run corresponding to the selected grid row

![Run fitting](pics/diff-studio-run-fitting.gif)

### Sensitivity analysis

Explore the relationship between inputs and outputs of your model using the [Sensitivity Analysis](function-analysis.md#sensitivity-analysis) feature. Run it directly from Diff Studio:

1. Click the **Sensitivity** icon on the top panel. **Sensitivity Analysis View** opens
2. Apply one of the following methods:
   * [Monte Carlo](function-analysis.md#monte-carlo)
   * [Sobol](function-analysis.md#sobol)
   * [Grid](function-analysis.md#grid)
3. Analyze model evaluations. Open `Context panel` (F4). You will get the simulation run corresponding to the selected grid row

![Run Sens Analysis](pics/diff-studio-run-sens-analysis.gif)

## Creating models

Turn on the **Edit** toggle on the top panel. Equations editor opens. Edit formulas or add new ones.
Click <i class="fas fa-sync"></i> **Refresh** or press **F5** to apply changes.

![Edit model](pics/diff-studio-edit-model.gif)

Go to **Browse > Apps > Compute > Diff Studio** and explore models from **Templates** and **Library**. They cover all capabilities of Diff Studio.

### Syntax and templates

A minimal model defining and solving ordinary differential equations contains
*name*, *differential equations*, *initial values* and *argument* specifications.

Use the `#name` keyword to define the name of your model:

```python
#name: Problem 1
```

Place differential equations in the `#equations` block. You can add as many equations as you want.
Diff Studio automatically recognizes all identifiers that you use.
You can use one-letter or multi-letter identifiers.

```python
#equations:
  dx/dt = x + y + exp(t)
  dy/dt = x - y - cos(t)
```

Define the argument, its *initial* value, *final* value, and grid *step* in the `#argument` block.
Datagrok provides a numerical solution within the range *[initial, final]* with the specified grid *step*.

```python
#argument: t
  initial = 0
  final = 1
  step = 0.01
```

Define initial values of the functions in the `#inits` block:

```python
#inits:
  x = 2
  y = 5
```

Use `#comment` block to write a comment in any place of your model

```python
#comment:
  You can provide any text here. Diff Studio just ignores it.
```

Place comments right in formulas using `//`

```python
#equations:
  dx/dt = x + y + exp(t) // 1-st equation
  dy/dt = x - y - cos(t) // 2-nd equation
```

Specify constants in the `#constants` block and parameters in the `#parameters` block.

Diff Studio treats `constants` and `parameters` exactly the same way.
However, when you [export equations](#platform-script-generation) to the platform script,
Diff Studio creates input UI only for `parameters` and leave `constants` hardcoded inside the script.

```python
#constants:
  C1 = 1
  C2 = 3

#parameters:
  P1 = 1
  P2 = -1
```

Define auxiliary computations in the `#expressions` block.
The **expression** is any mathematical function containing constants, parameters, argument, and other functions.
The only difference is that `expressions` functions are defined directly
and don't require solving of differential equations.
You can use expressions to separate part of the calculations and simplify your differential equations.

```python
#expressions:
  E1 = C1 * t + P1
  E2 = C2 * cos(2 * t) + P2
```

To customize the computation output, select columns and their captions in the `output` block:

```python
#output:
  t {caption: Time, h}
  A1 {caption: Central}
  A2 {caption: Periferal}
```

![Customize output](pics/diff-studio-output.gif)

#### Cyclic process simulation

Datagrok provides special capabilities for modeling cyclic processes.

Use the `#loop` feature to specify several modeling cycles.
Define the number of repetitions in the mandatory `count` variable and
use any mathematical expression to modify functions and parameters.
You can set new values for parameters and change values for functions.

```python
#equations:
  dy/dt = -y + sin(N*t) / t

#parameters:
  N = 1
  
#loop:
  count = 3
  N += 2
```

![Multi-stage model - loop](pics/diff-studio-loop.gif)

#### Multistage model

Use the `#update` feature to construct models with multiple sequential processes (stages).

Add name of the first stage in the `#argument` block:

```python
#argument: t, 1-st stage
  t0 = 0.01
  t1 = 15
  h = 0.01
```

Add the `#update` block. Enter name of the stage and set its duration. Add lines with model inputs updates. Use any valid mathematical expression to define them.

```python
#update: 2-nd stage
  duration = 23
  p = p * 2
```

You can add any number of `update` blocks. Simulation stages are marked with a color:

![Multi-stage model - update](pics/diff-studio-update.gif)

#### Solver settings

Manage the solver of ODEs to improve performance. Specify its settings in the `#meta.solver`-line:

* the numerical method (`method`)
* the maximum number of iterations (`maxIterations`)
* the maximum computation time (`maxTimeMs`)

Diff Studio implements the following [Rosenbrockâ€“Wanner](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2015.03.010) methods for solving ODEs:

|Method|Value|
|-------------|--------|
|The modified Rosenbrock triple|`'mrt'`|
|The ROS3PRw method|`'ros3prw'`|
|The ROS34PRw method|`'ros34prw'`|

By default, Diff Studio uses ROS34PRw and alerts you if computations take too long. The default time limit is 5 seconds. To customize it, set the maximum computation time (in milliseconds):

```python
#meta.solver: {method: 'mrt'; maxTimeMs: 50}
```

Set the maximum number of iterations to debug formulas in complex models.

Set [tolerance](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter19.02-Tolerance.html) of the numerical method in the `#tolerance`-line:

```python
#tolerance: 0.00005
```

#### Lookup tables

Lookup tables are pre-defined sets of model input values. They're organized as follows:

||x|y|...|
|-----|-----|-----|---|
|Set 1|1|2|...|
|Set 2|3|4|...|

To use a lookup table:

* Create a CSV file with your table and add it to your project
* Add the `#meta.inputs`-line to your model and specify a CSV file with a lookup table:

```python
#meta.inputs: table {choices: OpenFile("System:AppData/DiffStudio/inputs.csv")}
```

* To improve usability, define `caption`, `category` and a tooltip:

```python
#meta.inputs: table {choices: OpenFile("System:AppData/DiffStudio/inputs.csv"); caption: Mode; category: Settings} [Hint]
```

Use the interface to select inputs and compare model runs:

![table-lookups](pics/diff-studio-table-lookups.gif)

### Input options

Diff Studio automatically creates UI. Annotate model inputs to improve usability.

Define the desired captions for the input parameters. If no caption is provided, Diff Studio will use variable name.

```python
#argument: t
  start = 0 {caption: Initial time}
  finish = 2 {caption: Final time}
  step = 0.01 {caption: Calculation step}
```

Group inputs by specifying their `category`:

```python
#parameters:
  P1 = 1 {category: Parameters}
  P2 = -1 {category: Parameters}
```

Add `units`:

```python
#inits:
  x = 2 {units: C; category: Initial values}
  y = 0 {units: C; category: Initial values}
```

Provide tooltips in brackets `[ ]`:

```python
  P1 = 1 {category: Parameters} [P1 parameter tooltip]
```

Specify `min`, `max` and `step` values to get sliders and clickers for the rapid model exploration:

```python
#inits:
  x = 2 {min: 0; max: 5}
  y = 0 {min: -2; max: 2; step: 0.1}
```

## Platform script generation

For all Diff Studio parameters, you can add annotations described in

When you convert your model into the Datagrok script,
Diff Studio converts it to the script input annotations,
allowing Datagrok to automatically create rich and self-explaining UI.

You can convert any Diff Studio model to the Datagrok script:

1. Turn on the **Edit** toggle on the top panel.
2. Click **</>** icon. Script editor opens in a new view.
3. Click the **SAVE** button.
4. Script is created, and can be found in the "Scripts" section of the platform.

Find the created JavaScript script in the platform `Scripts` (**Browse > Platform > Functions > Scripts**).

Use `#tags: model` to add your model to the `Model Catalog`.
Provide a description in the `#description` line:

```python
#name: Bioreaction
#tags: model
#description: Complex bioreaction simulation
```

The export feature provides an extension of your project with [scripting](scripting/scripting.mdx) tools. Apply it to get:

* non-elementary and special functions' use
* Datagrok packages' functions call
