## Chemical reactions

Deterministic [mass-action kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action) models are defined by systems of nonlinear differential equations. The `Chem react` case simulates reactions given in the network

## Robertson model

Robertsonâ€™s chemical reaction model is a well-known example of [stiff equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation). It describes the process:

The `Robertson's model` case computes

Numerical solution of stiff problems is a complicated task. Datagrok's ODEs suite has tools for such cases. Both stiff and non-stiff equations are easily solved.

## Fermentation

The kinetics of the biochemical reactions in [fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation) is modelled by ordinary differential equations systems. The `Fermentation` case is an illustration.

Use [Compute](../compute.md) features to create a nifty app:

* Right click and select **Use cases > Fermentation...**
* Press <i class="fas fa-play"></i> **Run** and check results
* Press <i class="fa-file-import"></i> **Export** button
* Append annotation with

```javascript
//meta.runOnOpen: true
//meta.runOnInput: true
```

Save script and run the interactive model
