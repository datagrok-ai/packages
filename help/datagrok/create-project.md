# Create project

A project is a collection of different objects that you want to use together. A project can contain tables, views,
queries, connections, data jobs, Jupyter notebooks, predictive models, and resources such as files.

## Sharing projects

When a project is shared, recipients get access to all objects contained within the project. To control the privileges,
use sharing settings.
