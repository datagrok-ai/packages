# Flex View

Use this view to reference data, viewers, summary statistics, and other things from disparate tables. This view is a
good way to provide [project](project.md) summary. The content is stored in the [markup](../datagrok/markup.md) format (
directly editable in the
[properties panel](../datagrok/navigation.md#properties) on the right). That allows to reference pretty much anything in
the platform, including tables, [viewers](../visualize/viewers.md), columns, statistics, metadata, references to users,
and invoking [functions](functions/function.md).

It's always possible to edit the markup directly, but we have made it even easier to reference relevant content.
[Drag-and-drop](../datagrok/drag-and-drop.md) any entity into the view to reference it. The toolbox on the left provides
quick links to add the following:

* Common
  * **Clear** - clears the markup
  * **Summarize** - adds a quick summary for the current project
  * **View links** - adds links to all views currently opened
* Viewers
  * Add viewers for the specified table
* Statistics
  * Add statistics for the specified table
* Table
  * **Table link** - adds a table link
  * **Summarize** - adds table summary with columns in rows, and column tags as columns
* Column

* Add project-related content from the left pane
* Drag-and-drop objects such as tables or columns into this view
