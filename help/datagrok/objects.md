Certain classes of objects in Datagrok have a common set of operations and features applicable to them. We call these
objects _entities_. Here they are:

* [Function](functions/functions.md)
* [Function Call](functions/function-call.md)
* [Data Pipeline](../access/data-pipeline.md)
* [Data Connection](../access/data-connection.md)
* [Data Query](../access/data-query.md)
* [Data Job](../access/data-job.md)
* [DB Table Info](../access/db-table-info.md)
* [DB Column Info](../access/db-column-info.md)
* [User](../govern/user.md)
* [Group](../govern/group.md)
* [Model](../learn/predictive-modeling.md)
* [Notebook](../compute/jupyter-notebook.md)
* [Package](../develop/develop.md#packages)
* [Project](project.md)
* [Repository](../access/connectors/git.md)
* [Script](../compute/scripting.md)
* [Table](table.md)
* [View Layout](../visualize/view-layout.md)

The following operations can be applied to any entity:

* Getting its URL
* Referencing it in a [chat](../collaborate/chat.md), in [markup](markup.md), or in a [dashboard](../visualize/dashboard.md)
* Assigning [privileges](../govern/authorization.md), such as rights to view, edit, or share, to a particular instance
* Using it as a parameter in the [audit](../govern/audit.md) record
* Deleting it

* [Privileges](../govern/authorization.md)
* [Sharing](../collaborate/sharing.md)
* [Self-Learning platform](../learn/self-learning-platform.md)
* [Audit](../govern/audit.md)
