# Data export

When working on the Datagrok platform, you can always save the currently open data to a file or a set of files in your
local environment.

Currently Datagrok supports the following formats for data export:

* CSV
* Excel documents (.xlsx)
* JSON
* PNG
* PowerPoint presentations (.pptx)

To export file, use the corresponding button on the toolbar while a table view is open:

![Data Export](../uploads/pictures/export.png "Data Export")

It is possible to flexibly configure the format of the downloaded CSV file (**As CSV (options)**):

![Export CSV](../uploads/pictures/export-csv.png "Export CSV")

It is also possible to save the selected settings for use by default when saving to **CSV** format.

It is important to remember that when exporting to **CSV** and **JSON** format, only the table whose view is open (
currently displayed on the screen) is downloaded.

To save data from all open tables into separate CVS files, you can use saving as Zip archive. Such **Zip** archive will
contain not only CSV files with tables, but also **screenshots** of all tables and viewers added to all open table
views.

When saving in **Excel format**, each open table is saved as a separate sheet.

A PowerPoint presentation will contain screenshots of all tables and all viewers added to open tables.
