Scratchpad is a default [Project](project.md) in the workspace, which is opened when you start the application. When you
drag files into the platform, they end up in the Scratchpad.

To move tables and other entities between different project, use [Workspace Tree](workspace.md)
To exclude entities from project use context menu.

Upload scratchpad as your new project to server using _upload_ button and grant permissions to let other users see it.
