title: "Undo"
---

At the moment, Datagrok does not offer a full-fledged, bullet-proof undo
functionality, however some actions could be undone by pressing `Ctrl+Z`:

* Changing cell value by manually editing it in a grid
* Clearing the layout (`View | Layout | Clear`)
* Removing selected rows or columns (`Shift+Delete`)
* Closing a viewer by clicking on the `x` icon

Maximum one operation could be undone.
