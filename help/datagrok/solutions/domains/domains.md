Datagrok offers a broad range of general data analysis features
and provides excellent support for specific data analysis areas.

The [semantic data types](../../../catalog/semantic-types.md) system
and powerful [scripting capabilities](../../../compute/compute.md)
allows to easily customize Datagrok for any domain of knowledge.

This includes:

* Automatic recognition of domain-specific data types
* Highly customized data rendering
* Fast data-aware spreadsheets and visualizations
* Specialized data editing and filtering interfaces
* Domain-specific calculation and data processing functions
* Custom applications built on top of Datagrok platform

Out of the box Datagrok has extensive supports of cheminformatics
and bioinformatics domains.

For example, for cheminformatics you can
view rendered chemical structures for SMILES/SFD right in the spreadsheets,
filter and find molecules by substructure,
use specialized sketchers to edit chemical structures,
show chemical structures on the viewers, in tooltips and anywhere else,
apply large set of chemistry-specific analysis functions and modules.

For bioinformatics Datagrok offers
support of macromolecules data formats (FASTA/HELM),
sequence editing, search, and filtering,
structure-Activity Relation (SAR) analysis,
and more.

* [Bioinformatics](bio/bio.md)
* [Natural language processing](nlp/nlp.md)

To build support of your own domain of knowledge, review the Datagrok
[scripting capabilities](../../../compute/compute.md)
and [semantic data types](../../../catalog/semantic-types.md).
