# Oligonucleotide Sequence Design

[Sequence Translator](https://public.datagrok.ai/apps/SequenceTranslator/) is a Datagrok application that facilitates design and synthesis of [oligonucleotides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide).

## Translation

To facilitate translation of oligonucleotide sequences across different notations, such as FASTA or HELM, or formats used by specific synthesizers, the application provides a dedicated `SEQUENCE` tab:

![](img/st-sequence.png)

In the provided example, the translation is performed from a sequence written in the AXOLABS format into HELM notation and formats supportable by BioSpring and MerMade12 synthesizers. Any other format can be easily added to the output list on demand. The molecular structure of the corresponding polymer is also rendered and can be saved as SMILES or Molfile.

## Design

Oligonucleotides are characterized by the sequence
of [nucleotide modifications](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/SequenceTranslator#axolabs-nucleotide-modifications)
that make up the entire molecule. The length of the oligonucleotide is usually up to 35 nucleotides long. To facilitate creation and sharing of modification patterns, the `DESIGN` tab of the application is provided.

## Visualisation

It is also possible to visualize the molecular structure for a dimer, with a possibility to add an extra fragment of the antisense strand.

## Sequence representations

In the modification section on the right side of the screen you can select modification for each base in your input
sequence and check if PTO after the base is required.

Representations are splitted into categories by synthesizer's sequence format(BioSpring/Axolabs/MerMade).
