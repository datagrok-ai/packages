Now that you have deployed Datagrok, it's time to get benefits! This article gives you pointers
on how to start and grow your data ecosystem.

Here is where to get help:
* [Online help](https://datagrok.ai/help) for information on the platform
* **In-platform help** gives you hints and guidance on the current context. Press F1, or "?". 
* [Community forum](https://community.datagrok.ai/) for general questions, suggestions, or discussions
* [Datagrok YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Datagrok) for lessons, tips, product demos, 
  and recordings of the user group meetings
* **Interactive tutorials**: Complete at [public.datagrok.ai](https://public.datagrok.ai) or your corporate instance
  (requires the Tutorials package).

# Connect to data

It all starts with data, so let's go get it!

* [Connect to your databases](../access/databases/databases.md). Once a connection is created, 
  you can [explore its content](https://datagrok.ai/help/access/databases/#database-manager)
  , and [share it with others](https://datagrok.ai/help/access/databases/#access-control).
  Later on, we will learn how to write [queries](../access/databases/databases.md#working-with-queries)
  and use them in [interactive dashboards](../access/)
* [Connect to your file systems](../access/files/files.md).
