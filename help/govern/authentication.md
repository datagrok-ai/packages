# Authentication

Out-of-the-box, Datagrok offers the following authentication methods:

* [Login-password](#login-password)
* OAUTH (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
* Single Sign-on
* Active Directory

Enterprise customers might prefer to use a custom SSO (single sign-on) scheme. We can accommodate these needs by
developing a customer-specific integration.

## Login-password

Datagrok uses login and password to authenticate users. We keep your password salted with random data and encrypted with
1024xSHA-256 algorithm, so it cannot be read from our system. If you forgot your password - the only way to get access
to Datagrok is to reset your password, using link on login form.

## Authentication details

When user enters logs in, login and password pair is being passed to the server, and, if password hash matches stored
hash, session token is being generated. Now, every API call should be made with http header "Authorization: token",
where "token" is session token. After logging out this token won't work anymore.

Datagrok does not keep your password anywhere, after your log in.
