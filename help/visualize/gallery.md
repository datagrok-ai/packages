This is a list of all available viewers. Check [this document](viewers/viewers.md) to learn how to 
work with them, such as [creating](viewers/viewers.md#creating), [docking](viewers/viewers.md#docking), [interacting](viewers/viewers.md#interaction),
working with [properties](viewers/viewers.md#properties), 
[selecting](viewers/viewers.md#selection) and [filtering](viewers/viewers.md#filter) rows, using [tooltips](viewers/viewers.md#row-tooltips),
reusing [layouts](viewers/viewers.md#layouts), and a lot more!

| ![](viewers/line-chart-small.gif)      | [Line chart](viewers/line-chart.md) shows points connected by lines. Points are ordered by the X component, with multiple values for the same X aggregated. <br/> <br/> Supports multiple charts, multiple axis, different normalization and aggregation options. Multiple chart types: lines, area, stacked bar chart, stacked area chart.                       | 
| ![](viewers/bar-chart-small.gif)       | [Bar chart](viewers/bar-chart.md) presents grouped data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Select the "split" column to create a stacked bar chart. <br/> <br/> Supports multiple data type-dependent aggregation functions for values. Works with dates as a category, converting them to year, Q1-Q4, or month. |
| ![](viewers/box-plot-small.gif)        | [Box plot](viewers/box-plot.md) summarizes distributions of values by showing minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. <br/> <br/> Shows each point and lets you color-code them. <br/> <br/> When comparing multiple sets, automatically tests for statistical significance and calculates p-values.                                        |
| ![](viewers/pie-chart-small.gif)       | [Pie chart](viewers/pie-chart.md) shows proportions by dividing data into slices. <br/> <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![](viewers/pc-plot-small.gif)         | [Parallel coordinates plot](viewers/pc-plot.md) shows each row as a trajectory, where each column value gets mapped to the correponding axis. This is useful for analyzing in the multidimensional data.                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![](viewers/3d-scatter-plot-small.gif) | [3D scatter plot](viewers/3d-scatter-plot.md) shows the relationship between three variables in 3d space. <br/> <br/>  You can also color-code points, size-code points, and display labels next to markers.                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![](viewers/calendar-small.gif)        | [Calendar](viewers/calendar.md) Calendar lets you analyze longitudinal data.
