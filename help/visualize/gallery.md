This is a list of all available viewers. Check [this document](viewers/viewers.md) to learn how to 
work with them, such as [creating](viewers/viewers.md#creating), [docking](viewers/viewers.md#docking), [interacting](viewers/viewers.md#interaction),
working with [properties](viewers/viewers.md#properties), 
[selecting](viewers/viewers.md#selection) and [filtering](viewers/viewers.md#filter) rows, using [tooltips](viewers/viewers.md#row-tooltips),
reusing [layouts](viewers/viewers.md#layouts), and a lot more!

| ![](viewers/scatter-plot-small.gif)                     | [Scatter plot](viewers/scatter-plot.mdx) displays data points on the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) axes to show the relationship between two variables. By using marker color, shape, and size, you can show up to three additional data dimensions. | 
| ![](viewers/histogram-small.gif)                        | [Histogram](viewers/histogram.mdx) shows the distribution of the numerical data. Supports multiple distribution, with a few normalization options. Use the slider below to filter the dataset.                                                         |
