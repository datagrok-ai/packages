A [sunburst diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart#Ring) organizes categories into rings, revealing a hierarchy. It is also known as a Ring Chart or Multi-Level Pie Chart.

## Structure

The middle circle represents the root node. Categories spread out in rings around it.

Every ring stands for a particular trait or column.

We split and cut the rings based on their hierarchy in relation to the parent slice. Each sector on the outer rings displays a combination from the inner rings.

The sectorsâ€™ size reflects category correlation within the dataset. 

In the example below, you can see that the prominent yellow sector on the outer ring shows people who are `Caucasian`, have a `False` control status and are labeled as `Male`.

## Creation

To create a **Sunburst** viewer, navigate to the **Main Menu**
and select **Add > Javascript Viewers > Charts > Sunburst**

Columns with categorical data are automatically added to the sunburst viewer.

## Data exploration

Use the Sunburst viewer to explore the hierarchical nature of your dataset:

* To **zoom** to a category, click it.
* To **zoom out**, click the blue circle in the middle.
* To **reset view**, double click on the empty area outside the chart.

## Selection 

Sunburst viewer offers several selection options:

* To **select** a category, use `Shift` + `Click`.
* To **invert** selection, use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Click`.

Other viewers respond to the data selection and dynamically update the representation.

## Molecule rendering

A sunburst viewer renders molecular structures on the rings. When you hover over the structure, a label appears above. 

If the number of structures to show is excessive, only a part of the structures is visible.
