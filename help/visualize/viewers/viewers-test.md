# Tests: Viewers

A [viewer](../viewers.md) is a visual component associated with a table.

List of viewers available for testing:

* [Scatter plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)
* [Histogram](../visualize/viewers/shistogram.md)
* [Line chart](../visualize/viewers/sline-chart.md)
* [Bar chart](../visualize/viewers/sbar-chart.md)
* [Box plot](../visualize/viewers/sbox-plot.md)
* [Filters](../visualize/viewers/sfilters.md)
* [Trellis plot](../visualize/viewers/strellis-plot.md)
* [Tree map](../visualize/viewers/stree-map.md)
* [Calendar](../visualize/viewers/scalendar.md)
* [Google map](../visualize/viewers/sgoogle-map.md)
* [Grid](../visualize/viewers/sgrid.md)
* [3D Scatter plot](../visualize/viewers/3d-scatter-plot.md)
* [Matrix plot](../visualize/viewers/smatrix-plot.md)
* [Network diagram](../visualize/viewers/snetwork-diagram.md)
* [Parallel coordinates plot](../visualize/viewers/spc-plot.md)
* [Pie chart](../visualize/viewers/spie-chart.md)
* [Scripting viewer](../visualize/viewers/scripting-viewer.md)
* [Statistics](../visualize/viewers/sstatistics.md)
* [Markup viewer](../visualize/viewers/smarkup-viewer.md)
* [Word cloud](../visualize/viewers/sword-cloud.md)
* [Scripting viewer](../visualize/viewers/scripting-viewer.md)

Approaches to testing, Testing scenarios, test items in general are similar for all viewers. Categories of testing
scenarios common to all viewers were identified:

1. Creating a [viewer](../viewers.md). (UX, tooltips, graphic icons, on-screen display):

* From toolbox
* From menu "Add"

1. Correct construction of created [viewer](../viewers.md). Here we look at the correspondence of the chosen viewer
   type, correctness of construction from the point of view of math logic.

1. Working with a [viewer](../viewers.md) window:

* Moving the window by the workspace
* Zoom in\Zoom out
* Navigation inside viewer window
* Hover and select elements inside viewer
* Open\Close property window
* Display of help window
* The work of the controls located in the viewer area (e.g. popup menu "Size" on Scatter Plot)
* Return viewer after closing by **Edit | Undo** (```CTRL + Z```)

1. Property window

* Appearance and UI
* Moving the property window by the workspace
* Property search
* Change the property values of the "Data" item
* Change the property values of the "Appearance" item
* For [Scripting Viewer](../visualize/viewers/scripting-viewer.md):
  * Edit script in **Appearance | Script**

1. Context menu

* Call the context menu
* Navigation through the items of context menu
* Change viewer settings from the context menu

1. "Viewer" submenu

* Copy markup
* Properties
* Clone
* Use in Trellis
* Save to Gallery
* Embed
* Full Screen
* Close

1. "Style" submenu

* Pick up style
* Apply data settings
* Apply style settings
* Apply
* Set as default
* Reset default

1. "Tooltip" submenu

* Use a group tooltip
* Reset

1. Used input data

* Different types  (string, int, double, datetime, percent, bool)
* Full and non-full (with nulls or empty tables) data
* Selected rows should be highlighted on the viewer

## Sample test-case for testing viewers on example of "scatter plot"

1. Open *"demog"* table

1. Add "Scatter plot" viewer to layout (from "Viewers" tab on Toolbax or from "Add" menu)

* "Scatter Plot" added on layout
* Help switched to "Scatter Plot" page
* *"Weight"* column for X axis and *"Height"* column for Y axis are automatically established

1. Select *"Age"* column in "Size" selector on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)

* Points on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) displayed in different sizes depending on values
  ​​of *"Age"* column
* Under "Size" selector only columns with numerical types are represented

1. Drag *"Sex"* column from grid to "Color" selector on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)

* Points on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) displayed in different sizes depending on values
  ​​of *"Age"* column
* When dragging column, "Colort" selector on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)
  is highlighted

1. Delete *"Height" column" form *"demog"* table

* Y axis on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) switched to another suitable column

1. Delete *"Sex"* column" form *"demog"* table

* Color mapping off on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)

1. Open properties for [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)

* Viewer properties are displayed on [Property Panel](../../overview/navigation.md#properties)

1. Check performance and impact of changing properties on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)

* Data and appearance display properties changing the for  [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) affects
  expected
* After changing appearance properties the [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)
  does not displayed "default"

1. Pick up customized style of [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) as default from **Context menu |
   Style | Set as default**

1. Add one more [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) on layout

* New [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) has data and appearance settings as configured in step 8

1. Delete [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) from previous step

1. Reset view of [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) from it's context menu

* [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) style is now "default"

1. Use mouse wheel to zoom [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) area

* When scrolling wheel "away from you", [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) area zooming to current
  padding of the cursor

1. Select [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) area with ```Alt``` pressed

* Selected area is displayed on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)

1. Double click on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) area

* [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) area scale returned to default

1. Use [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) for tooltip of other viewers. Select **
   Context menu | Tooltip | Use as group tooltip**

1. Add [Histogram](../visualize/viewers/histogram.md) viewer to layout

* When hovering over histogram group tooltip is displayed, which
  shows [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) that corresponds to group

1. Delete all columns from *"demog"* table

* Nothing is shown on [Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) view
* No errors and crashes
