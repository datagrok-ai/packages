# VdRegions

VdRegions is used to visualize a graphical representation of multiple sequence alignment for several chains in peptide
structure per functionally important regions for example Complementary Determined Region (CDR) or Framework regions (FR)
of antibodies.

TODO: There should be a picture here, but we need to find data without restrictions.
