Radar viewer (a spider chart) compares multivariate data across several
dimensions. It plots numerical values of the table columns on axes that radiate
out of a center: the higher value is, the further it is from the center. The
values from the same table row are connected across axes with lines.

On radar viewer, you can compare the numerical values of different columns
within a row and rows’ values within a dataset. Radar viewer is commonly used in
the comparison, decision-making, and analysis, for example, in [elemental
analysis in
cheminformatics](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Chem#elemental-analysis).

You can use a radar viewer as a standalone chart or as an [inline viewer in
summary column](grid.md#row-summary-columns) of [grid](grid.md).

>Note: To use a radar viewer, install the package
[Charts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts).

## Add a radar viewer

* As a standalone viewer:
  1. On the menu ribbon, click the **Add viewer** icon. A dialog opens.
  1. In the dialog, select **Radar viewer**.
* As an inline viewer:
  1. Right-click a grid viewer. The context menu appears.
  1. Select **Add** > **Summary columns** > **Radar**.

Initially, a radar viewer picks up the first 20 numerical columns in the
corresponding table. For each column, it forms an axis and calculates the min
and max percentiles (5th and 95th). As row values, percentiles are also
connected across axes forming two color-filled areas.

## Configuring a radar viewer

To configure a radar viewer, click the **Gear** icon on top of the viewer and
use the **Misc** and **Color** info panels on the **Context Pane**.

For example, you can:

* Set the min and max percentiles by choosing their values from the dropdown
  lists in **Min** and **Max**.
* Toggle the display of percentiles using the **Show Min** and **Show Max**
  checkboxes.
* Set the background color for the percentiles’ areas using the **Background Min
  Color** and **Background Max Color** settings.
* Toggle value labels using the **Show values** checkbox.

## Interaction with other viewers

A radar viewer responds to the current row selection and doesn’t respond to data
filters.
