electrodes).

## Testing scenario

1. Open "ua_population" dataset

1. Add [Shape Map](../visualize/viewers/shape-map.md) viewer

* Viewer added
* Map of Ukraine regions is drawn on viewer

1. Change aggregation in selector on viewer

* Aggregations changes affect colors on the map

1. Click on region on map

* Row (s) selected

1. Select not matching rows (from viewer context menu or from "hamburger" menu)

* One row ("Kiev City 1") selected

1. Change display color (from viewer context menu or from "hamburger" menu)

* Color changes according to the selected palette

1. Test common features for viewers ([viewers-test](../visualize/viewers/viewers-test.md))
