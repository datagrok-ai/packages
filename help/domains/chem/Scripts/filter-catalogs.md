Filter by Catalogs give the ability to screen out or reject undesireable molecules based on various criteria.

Filter sets:

* **PAINS** - Pan assay interference patterns. These are seperated into three sets PAINS_A, PAINS_B and PAINS_C
* **BRENK** - filters unwanted functionality due to potential tox reasons or unfavorable pharmacokinetics
* **NIH** - annotated compounds with problematic functional groups
* **ZINC** - Filtering based on drug-likeness and unwanted functional groups
