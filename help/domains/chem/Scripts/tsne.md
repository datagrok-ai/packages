t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) is a tool to visualize high-dimensional data. It converts
similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data. t-SNE has a cost function that
is not convex, i.e. with different initializations we can get different results.
