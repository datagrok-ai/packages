# Tests: Fingerprints

Similarity measures, calculations that quantify the similarity of two molecules, and screening, a way of rapidly
eliminating molecules as candidates in a substructure search, are both processes that use fingerprints. Fingerprints are
a very abstract representation of certain structural features of a molecule.

## Testing scenario

1. Open *smiles.csv* file

1. Click on *"smiles"* column

1. Open *"Fingerprints"* dialog in *"Active"* tab on [Property Panel](../../datagrok/navigation.md#properties)
   (or use context menu for *"smiles"* column, **Chem | Fingerprints...**)

* *"Fingerprints"* dialog is open
* Help switched to "Fingerprints" page

1. Execute *"Fingerprints"* dialog with default parameters

* New column "Fingerprints" added to table
* Column Fingerprints" contains numbers of bits and sets for each molecule

1. Open *"Fingerprints"* dialog again

* History has saved parameters from previous run

1. Alternately execute dialog witch changing "Fingerprinter" field

* When changing "Fingerprinter" field the dialog parameters are change
* Required fields highlighted in red
* If value in required field is no value, ```OK``` is not active for clicking
* In result of dialog execution new column is created in table with values corresponding to selected Fingerprinter

1. Test non-functional modules (UI, help, navigation, console)
