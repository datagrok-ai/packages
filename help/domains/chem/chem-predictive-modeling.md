# Cheminformatics predictive modeling

Datagrok is a perfect platform for building, applying, deploying, and managing predictive models that are based on
molecules.

For cheminformatics, Datagrok simplifies the process of building, applying, and deploying models by knowing which
descriptors were used for building the model.

# Training

Train a model based on a measured response, using calculated descriptors as features. Use the
built-in [model building mechanism](../../learn/predictive-modeling.md) that supports different backends and dozens of
models with hundreds of hyperparameters available.

# Applying

[model building mechanism](../../learn/predictive-modeling.md#apply-model)

# Augmenting

A simple yet efficient way to deploy models is to use [info panels](../../discover/info-panels.md). This way, whenever a
user clicks on a chemical structure, or [sketches](sketcher.md) it, the predicted value will be shown in one of the
panels.
