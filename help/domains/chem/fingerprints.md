# Molecular fingerprints

Fingerprints are a very abstract representation of certain structural features of a molecule.

Similarity measures, calculations that quantify the similarity of two molecules, and screening, a way of rapidly
eliminating molecules as candidates in a substructure search, are both processes that use fingerprints.

## Available fingerprinters

| Fingerprinter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| RDKFingerprint | RDKit topological fingerprint for a molecule |
| MACCSKeys | SMARTS-based implementation of the 166 public MACCS keys |
| AtomPair | Atom-Pair fingerprints of molecule, hashed |
| TopologicalTorsion | Topological torsion fingerprints of molecule, hashed |
| Morgan/Circular | Family of fingerprints, better known as circular fingerprints, is built by applying the Morgan algorithm to a set of user-supplied atom invariants |
