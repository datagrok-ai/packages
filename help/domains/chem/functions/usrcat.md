# USRCAT

Ligand-based virtual screening using molecular shape is an important tool for researchers who wish to find novel
chemical scaffolds in compound libraries. The Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR)
algorithm is capable of screening millions of compounds and is therefore suitable for usage in a web service. The
algorithm however is agnostic of atom types and cannot discriminate compounds with similar shape but distinct
pharmacophoric features. To solve this problem, an extension of USR called USRCAT, has been developed that includes
pharmacophoric information whilst retaining the performance benefits of the original method.

The USRCAT extension is shown to outperform the traditional USR method in a retrospective virtual screening benchmark.
Also, a relational database implementation is described that is capable of screening a million conformers in
milliseconds and allows the inclusion of complex query parameters.
