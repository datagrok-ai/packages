* [Authentication](../../govern/authentication.md)
  * Login / password
  * OAUTH
  * Active Directory
  * Single Sign-On
* Authorization
  * Role- and group-based privileges
  * Dataset sharing policies
* [Audit](../../govern/audit.md)
* Managing [network file shares](../../access/file-shares.mdx)
* Managing [database connections](../../access/access.md#data-connection)
  and [queries](../../access/access.md#data-query)
* Data Storage
