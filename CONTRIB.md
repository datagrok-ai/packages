# Contributor's guide

## Requirements

1. Node version [12.22.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.22.7/)
2. Npm version 8.x.x: `npm install -g npm@8.x.x`
3. Latest `typescript`.

We are only using pure JavaScript in the packages not yet converted to TypeScript, such as
`public/packages/Charts`.

We use **only** TypeScript in all actual and new packages. Avoid using pure JavaScript.

## Code style

In this public repo, we follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

In particular:

1. **Add** intermediate spaces in `a, b`, `1, 2, 3`, `if (...`, `...) {`, `a == b`, and similar

2. **Do not** add empty lines in the beginning and/or the ending of the code block

3. The default is **2 spaces per tab**

4. We are *not strict*
   about [braces for code blocks of a single statement](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-braces-all)
   and [trailing commas](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#features-arrays-trailing-comma)
   .

5. When creating a package, use the `--eslint` flag to get an
   up-to-date [configuration file](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/tools/package-template/.eslintrc.json)
   .

6. **Do not** delete `package-lock.json` from the repository. Update it when needed

7. Document your code when there is a need for it, but do not overdo it. For instance, there is no reason to include
   information that is already in the function/class signature, such as types of parameters. Often, a one-liner is
   enough.

If you are using WebStorm IDE, we recommend you to stick to its defaults for JS/TS formatting, except for the spaces
settings: change its default value of 4 to 2.

Thank you for following the style!

## Using a linter

If you have created a package with `grok create ... --eslint`, the `package.json` file will already have the
required `eslint` dependencies, which would be installed together with others once you call `npm install`. Also, the
file `.eslintrc.json` with all necessary settings will be pre-created.

However, if you work with packages either not created with `grok create` or not having all the conditions above met, you
should still set up `eslint`. It is straightforward:

* Install `eslint`: call `npm install eslint --save-dev -g`
* Install `eslint` `google` settings: `npm install eslint-config-google -g`.

Make sure that your `.eslintrc.json` is actualized to using TypeScript (look
for `"parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser"`). If that's not the case, populate your `.eslintrc.json`
file with the settings
[matching this file from `datagrok-tools`](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/tools/package-template/.eslintrc.json).

## Git

In this public repo, we follow some Git best practices:

1. Configure the commit authorship. Set your name and email address correctly.

   ```shell
   git config user.name "<Name> <Surname>"
   git config user.email "<email@address>"
   ```

2. Write descriptive and meaningful commit messages. Commit messages will be included in changelogs
3. Keep your working branch up to date by frequently fetching changes from the remote server. It will prevent bugs,
   rework, and the tiresome resolve of conflicts
4. Test your changes before pushing to avoid the broken code in the repository
5. Refer to the issue or task number in your commit. It will help to track the work done on the task or issue
6. Name of branches should be meaningful. Please, use the agreed
   standard: `<first letter of your name><you surname>/<task ID and meaningful short description>`. Task ID can be from
   any task tracking system. Use the full ID. For example `jdoe/GROK-1234-description` for Jira issues or `jdoe/#123-description`
   for GitHub issues.
7. Do not mix "refactoring" with a new feature
8. Do not create unnecessary merge loops. To pull changes after commit creation use `git pull --rebase`. Run the
   following commands to make the work easier with rebase.

   ```shell
   git config --global pull.rebase true
   git config --global rebase.autoStash true
   ```

9. Push one commit at a time to avoid unexpected GitHub Actions behavior

## Performance recommendations

Some general recommendations on writing high-performance JavaScript code:

* [Writing Fast, Memory-Efficient JavaScript](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/)
* [JavaScript Performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/javascript_performance)
* [Chrome DevTools Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
* [Web development best practices](https://web.dev/fast/)

Below, we will discuss some performance-related topics important to building solutions with Datagrok. However, nothing
beats common sense, benchmarks, and eventually developing an intuition of how fast or slow a particular method would
work, and why. Here are some universal recommendations:

* Know how long each operation (network call, memory access, etc) should take
* Master the tooling (Chrome Profiler, Network tab, etc)
* Maintain a suite of benchmarks
* Look into problems, and check your assumptions using the Chrome Profiler

### DataFrame

**DO NOT** use row-based access for iterating over rows when [performance](help/develop/advanced/performance.md)
matters (pretty much anytime when the size of the dataset is not known in advance). Each call to `row(i)` creates
a `Row` object that is unnecessary, since the underlying storage is columnar. Only use it for passing a reference to a
particular row. Prefer using `column.get(i)` methods, instead.

### Iterables and arrays

**PREFER** using [typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays)
instead of the standard JS lists when working with numbers or bitsets, if possible.

When working with iterables, **DO NOT** create arrays for the sole purpose of iterating over their elements, this is
wasteful. Consider using [wu](https://github.com/fitzgen/wu.js/) instead, it is already included with Datagrok. For
instance, instead of using `Array.from(values).length` use `wu(values).length`.

**DO NOT** use temporary arrays for implementing a generic functionality as a one-liner. Instead, consider developing or
finding a utility function for that. The following code is wasteful (unnecessary allocation)
, slow (use of lambdas) and inefficient (likely a typed array would perform better).
`new Array(nItems).fill(0).map((_, i) => begin + i)`. A better way would be a specialized utility function if a real
array is needed, or [wu.count](https://fitzgen.github.io/wu.js/#count) if you only need to iterate over indexes.

### Common root causes of performance problems

* **Using the suboptimal algorithm**. Think whether a different approach would 
  be faster.
* **Doing unnecessary computations upfront**. See if the result
  is needed right now, or perhaps it could be computed later. Example: column tooltips
  are calculated dynamically right when a user needs to see it, but not earlier.
* **Computing what already has been computed**. See if the input has changed,
  perhaps there is no need for recalculation. 
* **Recalculating too often**. In case of applications reacting to the streams 
  of events, consider using event debouncing to allow multiple events to
  be fired, and then recalculating only once after that.
* **Using DataFrame's API for number crunching**. For maximum performance, consider
  working with raw data instead.
* **Inefficiently using memory**. For number crunching, one of the most important
  things that influences the performance is cache locality. Try to arrange data
  (usually in raw memory buffers) in such a way that your algorithm would access
  data sequentially. Minimize the memory footprint.
* **Using the wrong containers for the job**. Typical error is creating a list 
  of objects for the sole purpose to find out whether another object is in the
  list. Consider using Map.
* **Creating too many objects**. Each object comes at a cost - this includes
    allocation, memory consumption, and garbage collection. Think whether you 
    need it, especially within inner loops, or as part of a commonly used structure.
* **Chatty client-server interactions**. Calling a web service is expensive, and 
  each call introduce additional time penalty. Consider minimizing the number of 
  calls, and the amount of data transferred. Use `Network` tab in the Chrome Dev Tools
  to see what's happening.
* **Not caching results of data queries**. If the underlying data has a known
  change cadence (for instance, it's not changing at all, or ETL is run overnight),
  consider using Datagrok's built-in query caching mechanism.
