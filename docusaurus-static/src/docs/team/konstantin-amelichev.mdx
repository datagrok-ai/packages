<Card meta={meta}>

I wrote my first computer program at the age of 10. It was a program for lego traffic light robot and had no words, only visual blocks. My 10th program was written in Java in order to learn about Android applications. My 100th and 1000th programs were written as a training for national programming contests I was winning at high school. After that I stopped counting.

My academic background includes strong foundations in math and computer science, covering distributed systems and databases, machine learning and computer vision, computer graphics. Professionally, I've been doing backend development for bigtech companies and startups as well as teaching next generation of brilliant computer scientists. I identify as multilingual of computer science world and don't really mind which language you use. What I do care about are architecture, scalability, performance, safety and backward compatibility. And I'm glad to be a part of Datagrok team to improve the platform in these aspects.

During my free time, if I have any, I usually participate in orienteering races, which might not be popular but is the most adventurous activity I know. When there are no races, I enjoy exploring the city or playing video games: I dream of creating a nice indie game one day.
