<Card meta={meta}>

I have had a passion for math and programming, as well as natural science, since my school days. I have explored various areas within the IT sphere, from graphic design to data science, and currently work as an SDET at Datagrok. Although I am still searching for my niche, what I appreciate about my current role is the opportunity to participate in different stages of product creation and grow in various directions. In my free time, I typically study, read, or play PC games.

Over the years, I have had varying hobbies and interests, but currently, my main focus is programming and mathematics. However, if needed, I am able to lend my skills in areas such as system administration, radio engineering, design, art, or even geography, as I have basic knowledge of these areas. It enjoy being a resource for people on a variety of topics.

To work here, I think one should be ready to learn, have strong work ethics, be creative and passionate about what they do.
