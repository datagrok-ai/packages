<Card meta={meta}>

After earning my degree, I realized that it wasn't the right fit for me. I've always had a passion for connecting with people, which was reflected in my hobbies like playing board games and computer games with other players. Fate led me to a career in human resources, and I am proud of myself for taking the leap and embracing a significant change. I've transformed from someone timid about making phone calls to someone who regularly engages with others as part of their job.

At Datagrok, I have encountered numerous challenges and have had the privilege of working with talented and interesting individuals. These experiences have enabled me to continuously grow and develop in my chosen career path, aligning with my passions and interests.

Having conducted multiple interviews, I have come to realize that it is not enough to just have specialized knowledge in your field; possessing qualities that enable you to effectively integrate and contribute to a team are equally vital.
