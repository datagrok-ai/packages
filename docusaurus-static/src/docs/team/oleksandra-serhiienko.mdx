<Card meta={meta}>

I am a Scientific Application Developer for life sciences. My background is in Computer Science. My journey with software development began in middle school when I first tried coding in C++. Since then, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge, writing code in multiple languages, including C++, Python, Java, C#, and Typescript.

I am inspired by the potential of software to make a lasting impact on the world. One of my most challenging and rewarding projects to date is the creation of ADME calculators. Though itâ€™s an ambitious and challenging undertaking and while there is still much work to be done before the app will be released in production, it is gratifying to know that I am contributing to the discovery of new drugs.

In my free time, I continue to educate myself and improve my skills. I also enjoy choreography and learning new languages.

Datagrok is more than just a team; it's a family. To be a part of this team, you need to be responsive, have a strong desire to learn and grow, and be willing to tackle challenging projects that bring value to the world.
